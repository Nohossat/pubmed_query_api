Zhou,"Ulcerative colitis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease posing a great threat to the public health worldwide. Previously, gene expression studies of mucosal colonic biopsies have provided some insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms in ulcerative colitis; however, the exact pathogenesis is unclear. The purpose of this study is to identify the most related genes and pathways of UC by bioinformatics, so as to reveal the core of the pathogenesis."
Zhou,"Rice, being a major staple food crop and sensitive to salinity conditions, bears heavy yield losses due to saline soil. Although some salt responsive genes have been identified in rice, their applications in developing salt tolerant cultivars have resulted in limited achievements. Herein, we used bioinformatic approaches to perform a meta-analysis of three transcriptome datasets from salinity and control conditions in order to reveal novel genes and the molecular pathways underlying rice response to salt. From a total of 28,432 expressed genes, we identify 457 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) constitutively responding to salt, regardless of the stress duration, genotype, or the tissue. Gene co-expression analysis divided the core DEGs into three different modules, each of them contributing to salt response in a unique metabolic pathway. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses highlighted key biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the salt response. We identified important novel hub genes encoding proteins of different families including CAM, DUF630/632, DUF581, CHL27, PP2-13, LEA4-5, and transcription factors, which could be functionally characterized using reverse genetic experiments. This novel repertoire of candidate genes related to salt response in rice will be useful for engineering salt tolerant varieties."
Zhou,"Class III peroxidases are classical secretory plant peroxidases belonging to a large multi-gene family. Class III peroxidases are involved in various physical processes and the response to biotic and abiotic stress to protect plants from environmental adversities. In this study, 151 BdPrx genes were identified using HMM and Blastp program. According to their physical location, the 151 BdPrx genes were mapped on five chromosomes. The results of Gene Structure Display Serve and MEME revealed that BdPrxs in the same subgroup shared similar gene structure, and their protein sequences were highly conserved. Based on the analysis of evolutionary relationships and Ka/Ks, 151 BdPrx genes were divided into 15 subgroups, they have undergone purifying selection. In addition, the result of GO annotation showed that 100% of the BdPrxs participated in antioxidant. The protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the orthology-based method, found that 66 BdPrxs were involved in the regulatory network and 183 network branches were identified. Furthermore, analysis of the transcriptome data indicated that the BdPrx genes responded to low concentration of exogenous phytohormones and exhibited different levels of expression in the different tissues. Subsequently, 19 genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR and found to be mainly expressed in the roots, might preferentially respond to hydrogen peroxide and gibberellin. Our results provide a foundation for further evolutionary and functional study of Prx genes in B. distachyon."

Zhou,"Ecdysone is involved in regulation of embryonic diapause in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. However, its mechanism still remains unclear. To explore the role of ecdysteroidogenic pathway (EP) genes in diapause process of bivoltine B. mori, the eggs of ""Qiufeng"", a bivoltine strain, were used as the study materials and arranged into diapause eggs producers (DEPs) and non-diapause eggs producers (NDEPs), respectively. The differential expression of EP genes between two groups was analysed during the early pupal stage. The expression of Shadow was significantly increased in the NDEPs in day-3 pupae and reached the peak simultaneously, indicating that Shadow was in coincidence with diapause process. To validate this hypothesis, a repression of Shadow by RNA interference was performed in day-2 pupae of NDEPs. The expression of Shadow was downregulated by RNAi, and βFtz-F1, a downstream gene of EP, was also decreased. Furthermore, the genes encoding the kynurenine-synthetase were upregulated in the ovary, and Brown, AdenoK which link Shadow to the kynurenine-synthase gene were also upregulated in the fat body. The progeny eggs appeared a light purple colour at 48 h after oviposition, revealing a certain tendency to diapause. We speculate that inhibition of Shadow upregulates 3-hydroxy-kynurenine synthesis by increasing the expression of Brown and AdenoK. In addition, Shadow was cloned, and expressed in E. coli for further functional study of Shadow protein. Our study provided insight into the role of EP genes in the process of diapause of B. mori."
Zhou,"Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective strategy for rapid gene function analysis. It is well established that the NAC transcription factor and salicylic acid (SA) signal pathway play essential roles in response to biotic stresses. However, simultaneous silencing of two target genes using VIGS in plants has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we performed VIGS to silence simultaneously the SA-binding protein 2 (NbSABP2) and NbNAC1 in Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of simultaneous silencing of two genes. We first cloned the full-length NbNAC1 gene, and the characterization of NbNAC1 was also analysed. Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully amplified. Bacteria liquid PCR confirmed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully inserted into the tobacco rattle virus vector. The results showed that the leaves from the NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 gene-silenced plants collapsed slightly, with browning at the base of petiole or veina. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 were significantly reduced in 12 days post silenced plants after tobacco rattle virus infiltration compared with the control plants. Overall, our results suggest that VIGS can be used to silence simultaneously two target genes."

Zhong,"Gene expression in apple roots in response to various stress conditions is a less-explored research subject. Reliable reference genes for normalizing quantitative gene expression data have not been carefully investigated. In this study, the suitability of a set of 15 apple genes were evaluated for their potential use as reliable reference genes. These genes were selected based on their low variance of gene expression in apple root tissues from a recent RNA-seq data set, and a few previously reported apple reference genes for other tissue types. Four methods, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used to evaluate their stability in apple root tissues of various genotypes and under different experimental conditions. A small panel of stably expressed genes, MDP0000095375, MDP0000147424, MDP0000233640, MDP0000326399 and MDP0000173025 were recommended for normalizing quantitative gene expression data in apple roots under various abiotic or biotic stresses. When the most stable and least stable reference genes were used for data normalization, significant differences were observed on the expression patterns of two target genes, MdLecRLK5 (MDP0000228426, a gene encoding a lectin receptor like kinase) and MdMAPK3 (MDP0000187103, a gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase). Our data also indicated that for those carefully validated reference genes, a single reference gene is sufficient for reliable normalization of the quantitative gene expression. Depending on the experimental conditions, the most suitable reference genes can be specific to the sample of interest for more reliable RT-qPCR data normalization."
