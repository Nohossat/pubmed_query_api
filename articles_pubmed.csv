31978511,Selection and validation of reliable reference genes for Tolypocladium guangdongense gene expression analysis under differentially developmental stages and temperature stresses.,"Tolypocladium guangdongense, formerly known as Cordyceps guangdongensis, is a widely cultivated fungus of the Cordyceps s.l. species that has been investigated over the last 12 years. It has the potential to be used in a number of applications in the health and pharmaceutical industries for it has shown its high nutritional and medicinal values according to previous animal studies. qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) is extensively used to analyze the expression pattern and molecular mechanisms of functional genes under differentially experimental conditions. The expression stability of reference genes used for normalization determines the reliability of qRT-PCR results, indicating the importance of selection and validation of reference genes before gene expression analysis. In the present study, three statistical algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used for analyzing the expression stability of nineteen candidate reference genes (CRGs) in T. guangdongense. Investigation were carried out under differentially experimental conditions, which included differentially developmential stages (mycelia, primordia, young and mature fruiting bodies), different carbon sources, cold and heat stresses. The results showed that histone H4 and tubulin beta chain 2 (β-tub2) were the most and least stable genes, respectively, across all the experimental samples. Moreover, analysis of individual data sets exhibited different stability and expression profiles of reference genes. The vacuolar protein sorting gene VPS was the most stable gene expressed under the differentially developmental stages and temperature stresses, whereas H4 was the most stably expressed gene under different carbon sources. Therefore, it can be proposed that VPS and H4 are the preferred reference genes for normalization of gene expression under different experimental conditions. The results of our present study will enable more accurate evaluation of gene expression in T. guangdongense using the optimal reference gene for qRT-PCR analysis.",2020-03-03,"Algorithms, Cordyceps, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Fungal, Histones, Reference Standards, Stress, Physiological, Temperature, Tubulin",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2020.144380,Wang
32235512,Validation of the Reference Genes for the Gene Expression Studies in Chicken DT40 Cell Line.,"The selection of a suitable reference gene assures a reliable gene expression analysis when using the qPCR method. Normalization of the reaction is based on the basic metabolism genes. These genes show a constant, unregulated expression in all cells and function throughout their lifetime. In the current study, seven reference gene candidates were screened using RT-qPCR, to determine the best-matched pair of reference genes in the chicken DT40 cell line. The DT40 was derived from bursal lymphoma cells that were subjected to RAV-1 bird retroviral infection. It is a simplified in vitro model that allows tracking the direct interaction of stimulants on the lymphoid population and profiling of the hepatocellular B cell transcriptome. The reference gene analysis was carried out using statistical tools integrating four independent methods-geNorm, Best Keeper, NormFinder, delta Ct and RefFinder. Based on the selected reference genes, the relative gene expression analysis was done using the ddCt method. Complete relative gene expression study on a panel of the target genes revealed that proper selection of reference genes depending on the tissue eliminate decreases in data quality.

Four DGE libraries (2 for stem peel and 2 for leaf), ranging from 6.7 to 9.2 million clean reads were obtained, which produced 7.0 million and 6.8 million mapped reads for flax stem peel and leave, respectively. By differential gene expression analysis, a total of 975 genes, of which 708 (73%) genes have protein-coding annotation, were identified as phloem enriched genes putatively involved in the processes of polysaccharide and cell wall metabolism. Differential expression genes (DEGs) was validated using quantitative RT-PCR, the expression pattern of all nine genes determined by qRT-PCR fitted in well with that obtained by sequencing analysis. Cluster and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that a large number of genes related to metabolic process, catalytic activity and binding category were expressed predominantly in the stem peels. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of the phloem enriched genes suggested approximately 111 biological pathways.

32408659,Weighted Gene Correlation Network Meta-Analysis Reveals Functional Candidate Genes Associated with High- and Sub-Fertile Reproductive Performance in Beef Cattle.,"Improved reproductive efficiency could lead to economic benefits for the beef industry, once the intensive selection pressure has led to a decreased fertility. However, several factors limit our understanding of fertility traits, including genetic differences between populations and statistical limitations. In the present study, the RNA-sequencing data from uterine samples of high-fertile (HF) and sub-fertile (SF) animals was integrated using co-expression network meta-analysis, weighted gene correlation network analysis, identification of upstream regulators, variant calling, and network topology approaches. Using this pipeline, top hub-genes harboring fixed variants (HF × SF) were identified in differentially co-expressed gene modules (DcoExp). The functional prioritization analysis identified the genes with highest potential to be key-regulators of the DcoExp modules between HF and SF animals. Consequently, 32 functional candidate genes (10 upstream regulators and 22 top hub-genes of DcoExp modules) were identified. These genes were associated with the regulation of relevant biological processes for fertility, such as embryonic development, germ cell proliferation, and ovarian hormone regulation. Additionally, 100 candidate variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (INDELs)) were identified within those genes. In the long-term, the results obtained here may help to reduce the frequency of subfertility in beef herds, reducing the associated economic losses caused by this condition.",,,Genes (Basel),,Fonseca
26778241,Validation of housekeeping genes as an internal control for gene expression studies in Giardia lamblia using quantitative real-time PCR.,"The analysis of transcript levels of specific genes is important for understanding transcriptional regulation and for the characterization of gene function. Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) has become a powerful tool to quantify gene expression. The objective of this study was to identify reliable housekeeping genes in Giardia lamblia. Twelve genes were selected for this purpose, and their expression was analyzed in the wild type WB strain and in two strains with resistance to nitazoxanide (NTZ) and metronidazole (MTZ), respectively. RefFinder software analysis showed that the expression of the genes is different in the three strains. The integrated data from the four analyses showed that the NADH oxidase (NADH) and aldolase (ALD) genes were the most steadily expressed genes, whereas the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was the most unstable. Additionally, the relative expression of seven genes were quantified in the NTZ- and MTZ-resistant strains by RT-qPCR, using the aldolase gene as the internal control, and the results showed a consistent differential pattern of expression in both strains. The housekeeping genes found in this work will facilitate the analysis of mRNA expression levels of other genes of interest in G. lamblia.",2016-07-12,"Animals, Antiprotozoal Agents, DNA Primers, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Essential, Giardia lamblia, Metronidazole, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Thiazoles",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2016.01.018,Marcial-Quino

31187122,Rapid Evolution of Gained Essential Developmental Functions of a Young Gene via Interactions with Other Essential Genes.,"New genes are of recent origin and only present in a subset of species in a phylogeny. Accumulated evidence suggests that new genes, like old genes that are conserved across species, can also take on important functions and be essential for the survival and reproductive success of organisms. Although there are detailed analyses of the mechanisms underlying new genes' gaining fertility functions, how new genes rapidly become essential for viability remains unclear. We focused on a young retro-duplicated gene (CG7804, which we named Cocoon) in Drosophila that originated between 4 and 10 Ma. We found that, unlike its evolutionarily conserved parental gene, Cocoon has evolved under positive selection and accumulated many amino acid differences at functional sites from the parental gene. Despite its young age, Cocoon is essential for the survival of Drosophila melanogaster at multiple developmental stages, including the critical embryonic stage, and its expression is essential in different tissues from those of its parental gene. Functional genomic analyses found that Cocoon acquired unique DNA-binding sites and has a contrasting effect on gene expression to that of its parental gene. Importantly, Cocoon binding predominantly locates at genes that have other essential functions and/or have multiple gene-gene interactions, suggesting that Cocoon acquired novel essential function to survival through forming interactions that have large impacts on the gene interaction network. Our study is an important step toward deciphering the evolutionary trajectory by which new genes functionally diverge from parental genes and become essential.",2020-01-06,"Amino Acid Substitution, Animals, DNA-Binding Proteins, Drosophila Proteins, Drosophila melanogaster, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Duplication, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Essential",Mol Biol Evol,,Lee

31111371,Validation of suitable reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis in Tripterygium wilfordii.,"Validation of suitable reference genes is critical in quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. Suitable and reliable reference genes for the normalization of gene expression data are characterized by high gene expression stability across tissues and different experimental conditions. This study evaluated the gene expression stability of ten reference genes commonly used in Arabidopsis thaliana for their suitability in qRT-PCR analysis in Tripterygium wilfordii Hook.f. The orthologous sequences of these ten candidate genes were identified from T. wilfordii transcriptomic data (Project No. SRX472292). Five algorithms including GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder were used to assess the gene expression stability of these putative reference genes in different plant tissues and different stress conditions. The results identified ACTINT7 and TBP as the most suitable reference genes across all samples. The gene expressions of TwHMGR (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, KU246037.1) and of TwDXR (1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, KJ174341.1) were investigated to validate the suitability of the reference genes. The validation analysis confirmed the suitability of ACTINT7 and TBP as the best reference genes for elucidating secondary metabolite biosynthesis pathway in T. wilfordii.

31251967,Validation of reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis in Auricularia cornea.,"Auricularia cornea Ehrenb., previously named A. polytricha (Mont.) Sacc, has become one of the most widely cultivated mushrooms in China. Considerable research has been conducted on its cultivation, pathogen identification, proteomics, and more. However, to the best of our knowledge, no studies have been performed on reference-gene validation in this species. Formerly, reference genes were selected for their expression levels only relied upon from others species, owing to the fact that the gene stability in this species is unknown. In this study, nine candidate genes, including tubulin alpha-1A chain (TUBA1A), β-tubulin (Btu), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm), actin 1 (Act1), protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PP2A), polyubiquitin (UBQ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh), 18S ribosomal protein (18S) and 28S ribosomal protein (28S), were evaluated among different strains and developmental stages. Four algorithms (i.e., geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder) were used to analyze candidate genes. The results revealed that UBQ was the most stable reference gene, while 18S was the least stable. Despite these results, the candidate genes were largely inadequate and only two were considered suitable. Based on candidate gene stability, PP2A and UBQ were identified as a set of usable interior control genes for future analyses in this species.

29458166,Statistical approach for selection of biologically informative genes.,"Selection of informative genes from high dimensional gene expression data has emerged as an important research area in genomics. Many gene selection techniques have been proposed so far are either based on relevancy or redundancy measure. Further, the performance of these techniques has been adjudged through post selection classification accuracy computed through a classifier using the selected genes. This performance metric may be statistically sound but may not be biologically relevant. A statistical approach, i.e. Boot-MRMR, was proposed based on a composite measure of maximum relevance and minimum redundancy, which is both statistically sound and biologically relevant for informative gene selection. For comparative evaluation of the proposed approach, we developed two biological sufficient criteria, i.e. Gene Set Enrichment with QTL (GSEQ) and biological similarity score based on Gene Ontology (GO). Further, a systematic and rigorous evaluation of the proposed technique with 12 existing gene selection techniques was carried out using five gene expression datasets. This evaluation was based on a broad spectrum of statistically sound (e.g. subject classification) and biological relevant (based on QTL and GO) criteria under a multiple criteria decision-making framework. The performance analysis showed that the proposed technique selects informative genes which are more biologically relevant. The proposed technique is also found to be quite competitive with the existing techniques with respect to subject classification and computational time. Our results also showed that under the multiple criteria decision-making setup, the proposed technique is best for informative gene selection over the available alternatives. Based on the proposed approach, an R Package, i.e. BootMRMR has been developed and available at https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/BootMRMR.

However, in genome sequencing studies, the identification of disease genes among a candidate gene list is often difficult because of the large number of apparently damaging (but usually neutral) variants. A number of variant prioritization tools have been developed to help detect disease-causal sites. However, the results may be misleading as many variants scored as damaging by these tools are often tolerated, and there are inconsistencies in prediction results among the different variant-level prediction tools. Recently, studies have indicated that understanding gene properties might improve detection of genes liable to have associated disease variation and that this information improves molecular diagnostics. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate how understanding gene-specific properties might improve filtering strategies in clinical sequence data to prioritize potential disease variants. Improved understanding of the 'disease genome', which includes coding, noncoding and regulatory variation, might help resolve difficult cases. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of existing gene-level approaches, the relationships between measures of gene-pathogenicity and how use of these prediction tools can be developed for molecular diagnostics.",2020-01-03,"Disease, Disease Susceptibility, Early Diagnosis, Genes, Genetic Markers, Genome, Human, Humans",Brief Funct Genomics,10.1093/bfgp/ely033,Alyousfi

By far, researches on stable housekeeping genes in human heart failure samples are rare. Moreover the effect of heart failure on the expression of housekeeping genes in right and left ventricles is yet to be studied. Therefore we aim to provide stable housekeeping genes for both ventricles in heart failure and normal heart samples. In this study, we selected seven commonly used housekeeping genes as candidates. By using the qRT-PCR, the expression levels of ACTB, RAB7A, GAPDH, REEP5, RPL5, PSMB4 and VCP in eight heart failure and four normal heart samples were assessed. The stability of candidate housekeeping genes was evaluated by geNorm and Normfinder softwares. GAPDH showed the least variation in all heart samples. Results also indicated the difference of gene expression existed in heart failure left and right ventricles. GAPDH had the highest expression stability in both heart failure and normal heart samples. We also propose using different sets of housekeeping genes for left and right ventricles respectively.

Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the major model organisms and a readily accessible source of biological material for gene expression studies. To evaluate the expression stability of 12 candidate reference genes of C. elegans for exposing to different concentrations of Cry1Ia36 protein and different treat time, five statistical approaches (the comparative delta-Ct method, BestKeeper, NormFinder, Genorm and RefFinder) were used to evaluate each individual candidate reference gene. The results indicated that cdc-42 and F35G12.2 were the best reference genes for performing reliable gene expression normalization in the impact of Cry1Ia36 protein. In addition, when C. elegans was exposed to Cry1Ia36 protein and other nematicides, avermectin and 5-aminolevulinic acid, cdc-42 was recommended as the most reliable reference genes. Y45F10D.4 was the least stable reference genes in our experimental settings.

25481634,"Genome-wide identification and comparative expression analysis reveal a rapid expansion and functional divergence of duplicated genes in the WRKY gene family of cabbage, Brassica oleracea var. capitata.","WRKY transcription factors (TFs), one of the ten largest TF families in higher plants, play important roles in regulating plant development and resistance. To date, little is known about the WRKY TF family in Brassica oleracea. Recently, the completed genome sequence of cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata) allows us to systematically analyze WRKY genes in this species. A total of 148 WRKY genes were characterized and classified into seven subgroups that belong to three major groups. Phylogenetic and synteny analyses revealed that the repertoire of cabbage WRKY genes was derived from a common ancestor shared with Arabidopsis thaliana. The B. oleracea WRKY genes were found to be preferentially retained after the whole-genome triplication (WGT) event in its recent ancestor, suggesting that the WGT event had largely contributed to a rapid expansion of the WRKY gene family in B. oleracea. The analysis of RNA-Seq data from various tissues (i.e., roots, stems, leaves, buds, flowers and siliques) revealed that most of the identified WRKY genes were positively expressed in cabbage, and a large portion of them exhibited patterns of differential and tissue-specific expression, demonstrating that these gene members might play essential roles in plant developmental processes. Comparative analysis of the expression level among duplicated genes showed that gene expression divergence was evidently presented among cabbage WRKY paralogs, indicating functional divergence of these duplicated WRKY genes.

Using molecular phylogenetics, the genus Symbiodinium has been classified into nine major clades, A-I, and one of the reported differences among phenotypes is their capacity to synthesize mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs), which absorb UV radiation. However, the genetic basis for this difference in synthetic capacity is unknown.

31992780,Selection and Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies in Codonopsis pilosula Based on Transcriptome Sequence Data.,"Relative gene expression analyses by RT-qPCR (reverse transcription-quantitative PCR) are highly dependent on the reference genes in normalizing the expression data of target genes. Therefore, inappropriate endogenous control genes will lead to inaccurate target gene expression profiles, and the selection and validation of suitable internal reference genes becomes essential. In this study, we retrieved the commonly used reference genes in transcriptome datasets of Codonopsis pilosula by RNA-Seq (unpublished data), and selected 15 candidate reference genes according to the coefficient of variation (CV) and fold change (FC) value of gene expression. The expression levels of candidate reference genes, which is at different growth stages, undergoing cold stress and drought stress, was determined by RT-qPCR. The expression stability of these genes was evaluated using software packages and algorithms including ΔCt, geNorm, NormFinder and Bestkeeper. Then appropriate reference genes were screened and validated by target gene-UDGPase (UDP glucose pyrophosphorylase). The optimal RGs combinations of C. pilosula, including PP2A59γ, CPY20-1, UBCE32, RPL5B and UBC18 for developmental stage, RPL5B, RPL13 and PP2A59γ for cold treatment, RPL13 and PP2A59γ for drought treatment, were found and proposed as reference genes for future work. This paper laid foundations for both the selection of reference genes and exploration in metabolic mechanism of C. pilosula.",2020-06-02,"Codonopsis, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Plant Proteins, Reference Standards, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",Sci Rep,,Liang
28882568,Identification of pathogenic genes related to rheumatoid arthritis through integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiling.,"The purpose of our study was to identify new pathogenic genes used for exploring the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). To screen pathogenic genes of RA, an integrated analysis was performed by using the microarray datasets in RA derived from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The functional annotation and potential pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were further discovered by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis. Afterwards, the integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression profiling was used to screen crucial genes. In addition, we used RT-PCR and MSP to verify the expression levels and methylation status of these crucial genes in 20 synovial biopsy samples obtained from 10 RA model mice and 10 normal mice. BCL11B, CCDC88C, FCRLA and APOL6 were both up-regulated and hypomethylated in RA according to integrated analysis, RT-PCR and MSP verification. Four crucial genes (BCL11B, CCDC88C, FCRLA and APOL6) identified and analyzed in this study might be closely connected with the pathogenesis of RA.",2017-10-02,"Animals, Arthritis, Rheumatoid, DNA Methylation, Disease Models, Animal, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Humans, Male, Mice, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.08.032,Zhang
31925425,"Identification and Evaluation of Reference Genes for Normalization of Gene Expression in Developmental Stages, Sexes, and Tissues of Diaphania caesalis (Lepidoptera, Pyralidae).","Diaphania caesalis (Walker) is an important boring insect mainly distributed in subtropical and tropical areas and attacked tropical woody grain crops, such as starchy plants of Artocarpus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a powerful approach for investigating target genes expression profiles at the transcriptional level. However, the identification and selection of internal reference genes, which is often overlooked, is the most vital step before the analysis of target gene expression by qRT-PCR. So far, the reliable internal reference genes under a certain condition of D. caesalis have not been investigated. Therefore, this study evaluated the expression stability of eight candidate reference genes including ACT, β-TUB, GAPDH, G6PDH, RPS3a, RPL13a, EF1α, and EIF4A in different developmental stages, tissues and sexes using geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper algorithms. To verify the stability of the recommended internal reference genes, the expression levels of DcaeOBP5 were analyzed under different treatment conditions. The results indicated that ACT, RPL13a, β-TUB, RPS3a, and EF1α were identified as the most stable reference genes for further studies on target gene expression involving different developmental stages of D. caesalis. And ACT and EIF4A were recommended as stable reference genes for different tissues. Furthermore, ACT, EF1α, and RPS3a were ranked as the best reference genes in different sexes based on three algorithms. Our research represents the critical first step to normalize qRT-PCR data and ensure the accuracy of expression of target genes involved in phylogenetic and physiological mechanism at the transcriptional level in D. caesalia.",2020-01-17,"Animals, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Insect, Larva, Moths, Ovum, Pupa, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",J Insect Sci,,Wang
29704881,Transgene-independent heredity of RdDM-mediated transcriptional gene silencing of endogenous genes in rice.,"To induce transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of endogenous genes of rice (Oryza sativa L.), we expressed double-strand RNA of each promoter region and thus induced RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We targeted constitutively expressed genes encoding calnexin (CNX), protein disulphide isomerase (PDIL1-1) and luminal binding protein (BiP1); an endoplasmic reticulum stress-inducible gene (OsbZIP50); and genes with seed-specific expression encoding α-globulin (Glb-1) and glutelin-B4 (GluB4). TGS of four genes was obtained with high efficiency (CNX, 66.7% of regenerated plants; OsBiP1, 67.4%; OsbZIP50, 63.4%; GluB4, 66.1%), whereas the efficiency was lower for PDIL1-1 (33.3%) and Glb-1 TGS lines (10.5%). The heredity of TGS, methylation levels of promoter regions and specificity of silencing of the target gene were investigated in some of the TGS lines. In progeny of CNX and OsbZIP50 TGS lines, suppression of the target genes was preserved (except in the endosperm) even after the removal of trigger genes (T-DNA) by segregation. TGS of CNX was reverted by demethylation treatment, and a significant difference in CG and CHG methylation levels in the -1 to -250 bp region of the CNX promoter was detected between the TGS and revertant lines, suggesting that TGS is closely related to the methylation levels of promoter. TGS exhibited specific suppression towards the target gene compared with post-transcriptional gene silencing when GluB4 gene from glutelin multigene family was targeted. Based on these results, future perspectives and problems to be solved in the application of RdDM to new plant breeding techniques in rice are discussed.",2019-04-11,"DNA Methylation, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Silencing, Genes, Plant, Genetic Engineering, Oryza, Plants, Genetically Modified, RNA, Plant, Transgenes",Plant Biotechnol J,,Wakasa
31432118,Identification of key genes in osteosarcoma by meta‑analysis of gene expression microarray.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is one of the most malignant tumors in children and young adults. To better understand the underlying mechanism, five related datasets deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus were included in the present study. The Bioconductor 'limma' package was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and the 'Weighted Gene Co‑expression Network Analysis' package was used to construct a weighted gene co‑expression network to identify key modules and hub genes, associated with OS. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes overrepresentation analyses were used for functional annotation. The results indicated that 1,405 genes were dysregulated in OS, including 927 upregulated and 478 downregulated genes, when the cut off value was set at a ≥2 fold‑change and an adjusted P‑value of P<0.01 was used. Functional annotation of DEGs indicated that these genes were involved in the extracellular matrix (ECM) and that they function in several processes, including biological adhesion, ECM organization, cell migration and leukocyte migration. These findings suggested that dysregulation of the ECM shaped the tumor microenvironment and modulated the OS hallmark. Genes assigned to the yellow module were positively associated with OS and could contribute to the development of OS. In conclusion, the present study has identified several key genes that are potentially druggable genes or therapeutics targets in OS. Functional annotations revealed that the dysregulation of the ECM may contribute to OS development and, therefore, provided new insights to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying OS.",2020-02-04,"Adolescent, Adult, Bone Neoplasms, Child, Child, Preschool, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Neoplasm, Humans, Male, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Osteosarcoma, Young Adult",Mol Med Rep,,Sun

24279997,Gene expression profile analysis of Ligon lintless-1 (Li1) mutant reveals important genes and pathways in cotton leaf and fiber development.,"Ligon lintless-1 (Li1) is a monogenic dominant mutant of Gossypium hirsutum (upland cotton) with a phenotype of impaired vegetative growth and short lint fibers. Despite years of research involving genetic mapping and gene expression profile analysis of Li1 mutant ovule tissues, the gene remains uncloned and the underlying pathway of cotton fiber elongation is still unclear. In this study, we report the whole genome-level deep-sequencing analysis of leaf tissues of the Li1 mutant. Differentially expressed genes in leaf tissues of mutant versus wild-type (WT) plants are identified, and the underlying pathways and potential genes that control leaf and fiber development are inferred. The results show that transcription factors AS2, YABBY5, and KANDI-like are significantly differentially expressed in mutant tissues compared with WT ones. Interestingly, several fiber development-related genes are found in the downregulated gene list of the mutant leaf transcriptome. These genes include heat shock protein family, cytoskeleton arrangement, cell wall synthesis, energy, H2O2 metabolism-related genes, and WRKY transcription factors. This finding suggests that the genes are involved in leaf morphology determination and fiber elongation. The expression data are also compared with the previously published microarray data of Li1 ovule tissues. Comparative analysis of the ovule transcriptomes of Li1 and WT reveals that a number of pathways important for fiber elongation are enriched in the downregulated gene list at different fiber development stages (0, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18dpa). Differentially expressed genes identified in both leaf and fiber samples are aligned with cotton whole genome sequences and combined with the genetic fine mapping results to identify a list of candidate genes for Li1.",2014-03-11,"Cluster Analysis, Cotton Fiber, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Gossypium, Heat-Shock Proteins, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Mutation, Phenotype, Plant Leaves, Signal Transduction",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2013.11.017,Ding

Moreover have to be taken into concern the experimental conditions as they bias the regulation of reference genes. Up till now, no reference targets have been described for the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). In a search in the public database SalSite for genetic information of the axolotl we identified fourteen presumptive reference genes, eleven of which were further tested for their gene expression stability. This study characterizes the expressional patterns of 11 putative endogenous control genes during axolotl limb regeneration and in an axolotl tissue panel. All 11 reference genes showed variable expression. Strikingly, ACTB was to be found most stable expressed in all comparative tissue groups, so we reason it to be suitable for all different kinds of axolotl tissue-type investigations. Moreover do we suggest GAPDH and RPLP0 as suitable for certain axolotl tissue analysis. When it comes to axolotl limb regeneration, a validated pair of reference genes is ODC and RPLP0.

30694457,Selection of suitable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR gene expression analysis in Mulberry (Morus alba L.) under different abiotic stresses.,"Mulberry (Morus alba L.) is the sole food source for the mulberry silkworm, Bombyx mori and therefore important for sericulture industry. Different abiotic stress conditions like drought, salt, heat and cold stress adversely affect the productivity and quality of mulberry leaves. Quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) is a reliable and widely used method to identify abiotic stress responsive genes and molecular mechanism in different plant species. Selection of suitable reference genes is important requirement for normalizing the expression of genes through qRT-PCR study. In the present study, we have selected eight candidate reference genes in mulberry for analyzing their expression stability in different abiotic stress treatments including drought, salt, heat and cold stresses. The expression stability of these reference genes was determined using geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder statistical algorithms. The results showed that Ubiquitin and protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit A (PP2A) were the most stable genes across all the treatment samples. However, analysis of individual stresses revealed different expression profiles and stability of reference genes. Actin3 and PP2A were most stable in drought and salt conditions respectively. RPL3 most preferred in heat stress and Ubiquitin was most stable in cold stress. We propose the ubiquitin and PP2A are the preferred reference genes for normalization of gene expression data from abiotic stresses. In addition, Actin3 are preferred for drought stress, PP2A for salt stress, RPL3 for heat stress and Ubiquitin for cold stress studies.",2019-09-09,"Droughts, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Heat-Shock Response, Morus, Plant Leaves, Plant Proteins, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Stress, Physiological",Mol Biol Rep,,Shukla

26555275,With Reference to Reference Genes: A Systematic Review of Endogenous Controls in Gene Expression Studies.,"The choice of reference genes that are stably expressed amongst treatment groups is a crucial step in real-time quantitative PCR gene expression studies. Recent guidelines have specified that a minimum of two validated reference genes should be used for normalisation. However, a quantitative review of the literature showed that the average number of reference genes used across all studies was 1.2. Thus, the vast majority of studies continue to use a single gene, with β-actin (ACTB) and/or glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) being commonly selected in studies of vertebrate gene expression. Few studies (15%) tested a panel of potential reference genes for stability of expression before using them to normalise data. Amongst studies specifically testing reference gene stability, few found ACTB or GAPDH to be optimal, whereby these genes were significantly less likely to be chosen when larger panels of potential reference genes were screened. Fewer reference genes were tested for stability in non-model organisms, presumably owing to a dearth of available primers in less well characterised species. Furthermore, the experimental conditions under which real-time quantitative PCR analyses were conducted had a large influence on the choice of reference genes, whereby different studies of rat brain tissue showed different reference genes to be the most stable. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies.

31146023,Incongruence between gene trees and species trees and phylogenetic signal variation in plastid genes.,"The current classification of angiosperms is based primarily on concatenated plastid markers and maximum likelihood (ML) inference. This approach has been justified by the assumption that plastid DNA (ptDNA) is inherited as a single locus and that its individual genes produce congruent trees. However, structural and functional characteristics of ptDNA suggest that plastid genes may not evolve as a single locus and are experiencing different evolutionary forces. To examine this idea, we produced new complete plastid genome (plastome) sequences of 27 species and combined these data with publicly available sequences to produce a final dataset that includes 78 plastid genes for 89 species of rosids and five outgroups. We used four data matrices (i.e., gene, exon, codon-aligned, and amino acid) to infer species and gene trees using ML and multispecies coalescent (MSC) methods. Rosids include about one third of all angiosperms and their two major clades, fabids and malvids, were recovered in almost all analyses. However, we detected incongruence between species trees inferred with different matrices and methods and previously published plastid and nuclear phylogenies. We visualized and tested the significance of incongruence between gene trees and species trees. We then measured the distribution of phylogenetic signal across sites and genes supporting alternative placements of five controversial nodes at different taxonomic levels. Gene trees inferred with plastid data often disagree with species trees inferred using both ML (with unpartitioned or partitioned data) and MSC. Species trees inferred with both methods produced alternative topologies for a few taxa. Our results show that, in a phylogenetic context, plastid protein-coding genes may not be fully linked and behaving as a single locus. Furthermore, concatenated matrices may produce highly supported phylogenies that are discordant with individual gene trees. We also show that phylogenies inferred with MSC are accurate. We therefore emphasize the importance of considering variation in phylogenetic signal across plastid genes and the exploration of plastome data to increase accuracy of estimating relationships. We also support the use of MSC with plastome matrices in future phylogenomic investigations.",2019-11-29,"Base Sequence, Consensus Sequence, Genes, Plant, Genome, Plastid, Likelihood Functions, Magnoliopsida, Phylogeny, Plastids, Principal Component Analysis, Species Specificity",Mol Phylogenet Evol,10.1016/j.ympev.2019.05.022,Gonçalves
30699165,Identification of qPCR reference genes suitable for normalizing gene expression in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,"The mdx mouse is the most widely-used animal model of the human disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in the muscles of this animal plays a key role in the study of pathogenesis and disease progression and in evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. Normalization to appropriate stably-expressed reference genes is essential for accurate quantitative measurement, but determination of such genes is challenging: healthy and dystrophic muscles present very different transcriptional environments, further altering with disease progression and muscle use, raising the possibility that no single gene or combination of genes may be stable under all experimental comparative scenarios. Despite the pedigree of this animal model, this problem remains unaddressed. The aim of this work was therefore to comprehensively assess reference gene suitability in the muscles of healthy and dystrophic mice, identifying reference genes appropriate for specific experimental comparisons, and determining whether an essentially universally-applicable set of genes exists. Using a large sample collection comprising multiple muscles (including the tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart muscles) taken from healthy and mdx mice at three disease-relevant ages, and a panel of sixteen candidate reference genes (FBXO38, FBXW2, MON2, ZFP91, HTATSF1, GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, CDC40, SDHA, RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, PAK1IP1, B2M and HPRT1), we used the geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms to identify genes that were stable under multiple possible comparative scenarios. We reveal that no single gene is stable under all conditions, but a normalization factor derived from multiple genes (RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and the widely-used ACTB) appears suitable for normalizing gene expression in both healthy and dystrophic mouse muscle regardless of muscle type or animal age. We further show that other popular reference genes, including GAPDH, are markedly disease- or muscle-type correlated. This study demonstrates the importance of empirical reference gene identification, and should serve as a valuable resource for investigators wishing to study gene expression in mdx mice.",2019-11-08,"Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Genes, Essential, Genes, Regulator, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mice, Inbred mdx, Muscle, Skeletal, Muscular Dystrophy, Duchenne, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards",PLoS One,,Hildyard
29124515,Gene expression studies of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR: an overview in insects.,"Whenever gene expression is being examined, it is essential that a normalization process is carried out to eliminate non-biological variations. The use of reference genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin, and ribosomal protein genes, is the usual method of choice for normalizing gene expression. Although reference genes are used to normalize target gene expression, a major problem is that the stability of these genes differs among tissues, developmental stages, species, and responses to abiotic factors. Therefore, the use and validation of multiple reference genes are required. This review discusses the reasons that why RT-qPCR has become the preferred method for validating results of gene expression profiles, the use of specific and non-specific dyes and the importance of use of primers and probes for qPCR as well as to discuss several statistical algorithms developed to help the validation of potential reference genes. The conflicts arising in the use of classical reference genes in gene normalization and their replacement with novel references are also discussed by citing the high stability and low stability of classical and novel reference genes under various biotic and abiotic experimental conditions by employing various methods applied for the reference genes amplification.",2018-09-04,"Animals, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Essential, Genetic Markers, Insecta, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Transcriptome",Biotechnol Lett,,Shakeel

In this study, the diffe-rences of non-consistency and non-stationarity were analyzed from the perspective of composition of hydrological series. The inconsistent hydrological phenomena were generalized into hydrological processes with inheritance, variability and evolution characteristics or regulations. Furthermore, the hydrological genes were identified following the theory of biological genes, while their inheritance bases and variability bases were determined based on composition of hydrological series under diffe-rent time scales. To identify and test the components of hydrological genes, we constructed a diagnosis system of hydrological genes. With the P-3 distribution as an example, we described the process of construction and expression of the moment genes to illustrate the inheritance, variability and evolution principles of hydrological genes. With the annual minimum 1-month runoff series of Yunjinghong station in Lancangjiang River basin as an example, we verified the feasibility and practicability of hydrological gene theory for the calculation of inconsistent hydrological frequency.

For accurate normalization of gene expression in L. japonica using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), reference genes with stable gene expression patterns are essential. However, no appropriate reference genes is L. japonica have been investigated to date. In the present study, 12 selected housekeeping genes from L. japonica were cloned. We evaluated the stability of these genes under various experimental treatments by RT-qPCR using four independent (geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and Delta Ct) and one comparative (RefFinder) algorithm. We identified genes showing the most stable levels of expression: DIMT, 18S rRNA, and RPL13 during different stages; AK, RPL13, and TBP among sexes; EF1A, PPI, and RPL27 in different tissues, and EF1A, RPL13, and PPI in adults fed on different diets. Moreover, the expression profile of a target gene (odorant receptor 1, OR1) studied during the developmental stages confirms the reliability of the chosen selected reference genes.

28067311,Supra-operonic clusters of functionally related genes (SOCs) are a source of horizontal gene co-transfers.,"Adaptation of bacteria occurs predominantly via horizontal gene transfer (HGT). While it is widely recognized that horizontal acquisitions frequently encompass multiple genes, it is unclear what the size distribution of successfully transferred DNA segments looks like and what evolutionary forces shape this distribution. Here, we identified 1790 gene family pairs that were consistently co-gained on the same branches across a phylogeny of 53 E. coli strains. We estimated a lower limit of their genomic distances at the time they were transferred to their host genomes; this distribution shows a sharp upper bound at 30 kb. The same gene-pairs can have larger distances (up to 70 kb) in other genomes. These more distant pairs likely represent recent acquisitions via transduction that involve the co-transfer of excised prophage genes, as they are almost always associated with intervening phage-associated genes. The observed distribution of genomic distances of co-transferred genes is much broader than expected from a model based on the co-transfer of genes within operons; instead, this distribution is highly consistent with the size distribution of supra-operonic clusters (SOCs), groups of co-occurring and co-functioning genes that extend beyond operons. Thus, we propose that SOCs form a basic unit of horizontal gene transfer.",2018-10-18,"Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genes, Multigene Family, Operon",Sci Rep,,Pang
28974200,Selection of reliable reference genes for the normalisation of gene expression levels following time course LPS stimulation of murine bone marrow derived macrophages.,"Macrophages are key players in the initiation, perpetuation and regulation of both innate and adaptive immune responses. They largely perform these roles through modulation of the expression of genes, especially those encoding cytokines. Murine bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) are commonly used as a model macrophage population for the study of immune responses to pro-inflammatory stimuli, notably lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which may be pertinent to the human situation. Evaluation of the temporal responses of LPS stimulated macrophages is widely conducted via the measurement of gene expression levels by RT-qPCR. While providing a robust and sensitive measure of gene expression levels, RT-qPCR relies on the normalisation of gene expression data to a stably expressed reference gene. Generally, a normalisation gene(s) is selected from a list of ""traditional"" reference genes without validation of expression stability under the specific experimental conditions of the study.

29234908,Characterization of type IV antifreeze gene in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) and influence of cold and hot weather on its expression and some immune-related genes.,"The aim of this work is to study the effect of the thermal stress of ambient temperature during winter and summer on the expression of type IV antifreeze gene (ANF IV) in different tissues of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) as well as some immune-related genes. At first, genomic ANF IV gene was characterized from one fish; 124 amino acids were identified with 92.7% similarity with that on the gene bank. Expression of ANF IV and immune-related genes were done twice, once at the end of December (winter sample, temperature 14 °C) and the other at August (summer sample, temperature 36 °C). Assessment of ANF IV gene expression in different organs of fish was done; splenic mRNA was used for assessment of immune-related gene transcripts (CXCl2 chemokine, cc-chemokine, INF-3A, and MHC IIβ). Winter expression analysis of AFP IV in O. niloticus revealed significant upregulation of mRNA transcript levels in the intestine, gills, skin, spleen, liver, and brain with 324.03-, 170.06-, 107.63-, 97.61-, 94.35-, and 27.85-folds, respectively. Furthermore, upregulation in the gene was observed in some organs during summer: in the liver, gills, skin, intestine, and brain with lower levels compared with winter. The level of expression of immune-related genes in winter is significantly higher than summer in all assessed genes. Cc-chemokine gene expression was the most affected in both winter and summer. Variable expression profile of ANF IV in different organs and in different seasons together with its amino acid similarity of N-terminal and C-terminal with apolipoprotein (lipid binder) and form of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) suggests a different role for this protein which may be related to lipid metabolism.",2018-10-23,"Animals, Antifreeze Proteins, Type IV, Chemokines, Cichlids, Cold Temperature, Fish Proteins, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, MHC Class II, Hot Temperature, Interferons, Weather",Fish Physiol Biochem,,Ammar

31063803,Lineage/species-specific expansion of the Mx gene family in teleosts: Differential expression and modulation of nine Mx genes in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss.,"Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are interferon (IFN)-inducible Dynamin-like GTPases, which play an important role in antiviral immunity. Three Mx genes (Mx1-3) have been cloned previously in rainbow trout. In this study, an additional six Mx genes were cloned that reside in four chromosomal loci. Further bioinformatics analysis suggests the presence of three teleost Mx groups (TMG) each with a characteristic gene organisation. Salmonid Mx belong to TMG1 and TMG2. The increased salmonid Mx gene copies are due mainly to local gene duplications that happened before and after salmonid speciation, in a lineage/species specific manner. Trout Mx molecules have been diversified in the loop 1 and 4 regions, and in the nuclear localisation signal in loop 4. The trout Mx genes were shown to be differentially expressed in tissues, with high levels of expression of TMG1 (Mx1-4) in blood and TMG2 (Mx5-9) in intestine. The expression of the majority of the trout Mx genes was induced by poly IC in vitro and in vivo, and increased during development. In addition, induction by antiviral (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines was studied, and showed that type I IFN, IFNγ and IL-1β can induce Mx gene expression in an Mx gene-, cytokine- and cell line-dependent manner. These results show that salmonids possess a large number Mx genes as well as complex regulatory pathways, which may contribute to their success in an anadromous life style.",2019-08-20,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Cytokines, Fish Diseases, Fish Proteins, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Immunity, Innate, Multigene Family, Myxovirus Resistance Proteins, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Phylogeny, Poly I-C, Sequence Alignment",Fish Shellfish Immunol,10.1016/j.fsi.2019.04.303,Wang

On the basis of a literature review, eight genes were selected: Actb, B2m, Hprt1, Ppia, Rplp0, Rpl13a, Rpl5, and Ywhaz. Genes were ranked according to their stability under different culture conditions as assessed using GenNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder algorithms. Although the employed algorithms returned different rankings, the most frequently top-ranked genes were: B2m and/or Ppia for all 28day treatments (ALL28); Ppia and Hprt1 (adipogenic differentiation; A28), B2m (chondrogenic differentiation; C28), Rpl5 (controls maintained in complete culture medium; CCM), Rplp0 (osteogenic differentiation for 3days; O3), Rpl13a and Actb (osteogenic differentiation for 7days; O7), Rplp0 and Ppia (osteogenic differentiation for 14days; O14), Hprt1 and Ppia (osteogenic differentiation for 28days; O28), as well as Actb (all osteogenesis time points combined; ALLOSTEO).

31381952,Transcripts of the nebulin gene from Ciona heart and their implications for the evolution of nebulin family genes.,"Nebulin is a 770 kDa protein that is localized along the thin filaments of skeletal muscles in vertebrates. It is also present in the striated muscles of Amphioxus, an invertebrate cephalochordate that is phylogenetically close to vertebrates. However, the nebulin of urochordate ascidians or its expression in invertebrate hearts has not been investigated. In this study, we investigated the structure and cardiac expression of the nebulin gene in Ciona intestinalis, a urochordate whose phylogeny lies between cephalochordates and vertebrates. As a result of the gene structure analysis, we found that the Ciona nebulin gene predicted to be 62 kb and consists of 143 exons. The nebulin was expected to consist of a unique N-terminal region, followed by 155 nebulin repeats, another unique region, a Ser-rich region and a C-terminal SH3 domain. Whole-mount in situ hybridization experiments showed that the Ciona nebulin gene was expressed in a variety of muscles, including hearts. However, Western blot analysis using antibody to Ciona nebulin did not detect the presence of full-length nebulin. Alternatively, RT-PCR experiments on samples of Ciona heart detected the expression of nebulette-like and nrap-like isoforms from the Ciona nebulin gene. These results indicate that, similarly to vertebrate hearts, Ciona hearts do not express nebulin, but rather nrap- and nebulette-like isoforms. These results also imply that the nebulin, nebulette and nrap genes in vertebrates were separated from an ancestral invertebrate nebulin gene during vertebrate evolution.",2019-09-03,"Animals, Ciona intestinalis, Evolution, Molecular, Exons, Introns, Multigene Family, Muscle Proteins, Myocardium, Protein Domains, RNA, Messenger",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144036,Nishikawa
32565973,Identification of key genes associated with the progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"The present study aimed to identify the key genes that are associated with the progression of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of three gene datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, including GSE107943, GSE119336 and GSE26566. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues and adjacent liver tissues were identified using GSE107943, while tissue specific genes between bile duct and liver tissues were identified using GSE26566. Following the removal of tissue-specific genes, real DEGs were used to construct the WGCNA to investigate the association between gene modules and clinical traits. Following functional analysis, pathway enrichment analysis and the construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were performed, hub genes were selected and their diagnostic value was verified in GSE119336 using a receiver operating characteristic curve. Finally, the protein levels of the hub genes were also verified in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. A total of 1,643 real DEGs were identified and used to construct the WGCNA. Additionally, a total of seven co-expressed gene modules were identified following WGCNA, while genes in brown and yellow modules were identified to be associated with multiple clinical traits (the number of clinical traits >3) and used as key modules. A total of 63 core key module genes were subsequently identified, and it was indicated that these genes were most enriched in the nucleus (Gene Ontology term) and the cell cycle pathway (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes term). Finally, a total of eight genes, including cyclin B1, cell division cycle 20, cell division cycle associated 8, cyclin dependent kinase 1, centrosomal protein 55, kinesin family member 2C, DNA topoisomerase IIα and TPX2 microtubule nucleation factor, exhibited the highest score in PPI analysis and had a high diagnostic value for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. In addition, the protein levels of these genes were also revealed to be increased in most intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues. These eight genes may be used as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.",,,Oncol Lett,,Ye

26428313,Reference gene selection for quantitative gene expression studies during biological invasions: A test on multiple genes and tissues in a model ascidian Ciona savignyi.,"As invasive species have successfully colonized a wide range of dramatically different local environments, they offer a good opportunity to study interactions between species and rapidly changing environments. Gene expression represents one of the primary and crucial mechanisms for rapid adaptation to local environments. Here, we aim to select reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis based on quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) for a model invasive ascidian, Ciona savignyi. We analyzed the stability of ten candidate reference genes in three tissues (siphon, pharynx and intestine) under two key environmental stresses (temperature and salinity) in the marine realm based on three programs (geNorm, NormFinder and delta Ct method). Our results demonstrated only minor difference for stability rankings among the three methods. The use of different single reference gene might influence the data interpretation, while multiple reference genes could minimize possible errors. Therefore, reference gene combinations were recommended for different tissues - the optimal reference gene combination for siphon was RPS15 and RPL17 under temperature stress, and RPL17, UBQ and TubA under salinity treatment; for pharynx, TubB, TubA and RPL17 were the most stable genes under temperature stress, while TubB, TubA and UBQ were the best under salinity stress; for intestine, UBQ, RPS15 and RPL17 were the most reliable reference genes under both treatments. Our results suggest that the necessity of selection and test of reference genes for different tissues under varying environmental stresses. The results obtained here are expected to reveal mechanisms of gene expression-mediated invasion success using C. savignyi as a model species.

While the C57BL/6 and ApoE-/- mouse models are widely used to study gene expression changes in liver disease and metabolism, currently there are no validated stably expressed endogenous genes in these models, neither is it known how gene expression varies within and across liver lobes. Here we show regional variations in the expression of Ywhaz, Gak, Gapdh, Hmbs and Act-β endogenous genes across a liver lobe; Using homogeneous samples from the four liver lobes of 6 C57BL/6 mice we tested the stability of 12 endogenous genes and show that Act-β and Eif2-α are the most stably expressed endogenous genes in all four lobes and demonstrate lobular differences in the expression of Abca1 cholesterol efflux gene. These results suggest that sampling from a specified homogeneous powdered liver lobe is paramount in enhancing data reliability and reproducibility. The stability of the 12 endogenous genes was further tested using homogeneous samples of left liver lobes from 20 ApoE-/- mice on standard or high polyphenol diets.

31185291,Evaluation and validation of experimental condition-specific reference genes for normalization of gene expression in Asia II-I Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae).,"Functional genomics in whitefly, Bemisia tabaci is gaining impetus due to its polyphagous nature, worldwide distribution and recently sequenced whole genome. These studies require an in-depth evaluation and validation of reference genes in different development stages and variable experimental setups. Normalization with reference genes is an essential step in the gene expression studies. Rather than selecting a reference gene empirically, the suitability of these genes must be validated for an individual organism, its specific stage or even for particular experimental conditions. The Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has evolved as an efficient and widely used technique for precise monitoring of gene expression. The prime focus of this study was to identify candidate reference genes in different developmental stages (adults, nymphs, eggs), sex (male and female), hosts (Gossypium hirsutum, G. arboreum), and under insecticidal and starvation stress. Expression stability of these genes in different experimental samples was evaluated by employing five different computational algorithms such as NormFinder, BestKeeper, Comparative delta-CT, geNorm and RefFinder. Our results identified a different set of reference genes under each experimental setup such as electron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (ETF-QO), ubiquitin (UBIQ) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) as best reference genes in adult whitefly. In addition, glutathione S-transferase (GST) in eggs, cyclophilin (CYCLOPH) in red eyed nymph, GAPDH in third instar, tubulin (Tub) in female, ubiquitin ribosomal protein S27 (UBIRPS2) in male, succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit B (SDHB) under insecticidal stress, ETF-QO under starvation stress, UBIRPS2 under host influence were the top most stable genes.

30327994,Global transcriptome and weighted gene co-expression network analyses reveal hybrid-specific modules and candidate genes related to plant height development in maize.,"Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was explored to find key hub genes involved in plant height regulation. Plant height, an important trait for maize breeding because of its close relatedness to lodging resistance and yield, has been reported to be determined by multiple qualitative and quantitative genes. However, few genes related to plant height have been characterized in maize. Herein, three different maize hybrids, with extremely distinct plant height, which were further classified into low (L), middle (M) and high (H) group, were selected for RNA sequencing at three key developmental stages, namely, jointing stage (I), big flare period (II) and tasseling stage (III). Intriguingly, transcriptome profiles for hybrids ranging from low to high group exhibited significantly similarity in both jointing stage and big flare period. However, remarkably larger differentially expressed genes could be detected between hybrid from low to either middle or high group in tasseling stage. These results were repeatedly observed in both phenotyping and gene ontology enrichment analysis, indicating that transition from big flare period to tasseling stage plays a critical role in determination of plant height. Furthermore, weighted gene co-expression network analysis was explored to find key hub genes involved in plant height regulation. Hundreds of candidate genes, encoding various transcription factors, and regulators involved in internode cell regulation and cell wall synthesis were identified in our network. More importantly, great majority of candidates were correlated to either metabolism or signaling pathway of several plant phytohormones. Particularly, numerous functionally characterized genes in gibberellic acid as well as brassinosteroids signaling transduction pathways were also discovered, suggesting their critical roles in plant height regulation. The present study could provide a modestly comprehensive insight into networks for regulation of plant height in maize.",2018-11-02,"Crosses, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genotype, Multigene Family, Transcriptome, Zea mays",Plant Mol Biol,,Wang

28934340,Using RNA-seq data to select reference genes for normalizing gene expression in apple roots.,"Gene expression in apple roots in response to various stress conditions is a less-explored research subject. Reliable reference genes for normalizing quantitative gene expression data have not been carefully investigated. In this study, the suitability of a set of 15 apple genes were evaluated for their potential use as reliable reference genes. These genes were selected based on their low variance of gene expression in apple root tissues from a recent RNA-seq data set, and a few previously reported apple reference genes for other tissue types. Four methods, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were used to evaluate their stability in apple root tissues of various genotypes and under different experimental conditions. A small panel of stably expressed genes, MDP0000095375, MDP0000147424, MDP0000233640, MDP0000326399 and MDP0000173025 were recommended for normalizing quantitative gene expression data in apple roots under various abiotic or biotic stresses. When the most stable and least stable reference genes were used for data normalization, significant differences were observed on the expression patterns of two target genes, MdLecRLK5 (MDP0000228426, a gene encoding a lectin receptor like kinase) and MdMAPK3 (MDP0000187103, a gene encoding a mitogen-activated protein kinase). Our data also indicated that for those carefully validated reference genes, a single reference gene is sufficient for reliable normalization of the quantitative gene expression. Depending on the experimental conditions, the most suitable reference genes can be specific to the sample of interest for more reliable RT-qPCR data normalization.",2017-10-18,"Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Plant, Malus, Plant Roots, Reference Standards, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Stress, Physiological",PLoS One,,Zhou

28338988,Phylogenetics of Lophotrochozoan bHLH Genes and the Evolution of Lineage-Specific Gene Duplicates.,"The gain and loss of genes encoding transcription factors is of importance to understanding the evolution of gene regulatory complexity. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) genes encode a large superfamily of transcription factors. We systematically classify the bHLH genes from five mollusc, two annelid and one brachiopod genomes, tracing the pattern of bHLH gene evolution across these poorly studied Phyla. In total, 56-88 bHLH genes were identified in each genome, with most identifiable as members of previously described bilaterian families, or of new families we define. Of such families only one, Mesp, appears lost by all these species. Additional duplications have also played a role in the evolution of the bHLH gene repertoire, with many new lophotrochozoan-, mollusc-, bivalve-, or gastropod-specific genes defined. Using a combination of transcriptome mining, RT-PCR, and in situ hybridization we compared the expression of several of these novel genes in tissues and embryos of the molluscs Crassostrea gigas and Patella vulgata, finding both conserved expression and evidence for neofunctionalization. We also map the positions of the genes across these genomes, identifying numerous gene linkages. Some reflect recent paralog divergence by tandem duplication, others are remnants of ancient tandem duplications dating to the lophotrochozoan or bilaterian common ancestors. These data are built into a model of the evolution of bHLH genes in molluscs, showing formidable evolutionary stasis at the family level but considerable within-family diversification by tandem gene duplication.",2017-05-05,"Animals, Annelida, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors, Evolution, Molecular, Exons, Gene Duplication, Gene Expression, Genome, Introns, Invertebrates, Mollusca, Multigene Family, Phylogeny",Genome Biol Evol,,Bao

26115844,Genes with minimal phylogenetic information are problematic for coalescent analyses when gene tree estimation is biased.,"The development and application of coalescent methods are undergoing rapid changes. One little explored area that bears on the application of gene-tree-based coalescent methods to species tree estimation is gene informativeness. Here, we investigate the accuracy of these coalescent methods when genes have minimal phylogenetic information, including the implementation of the multilocus bootstrap approach. Using simulated DNA sequences, we demonstrate that genes with minimal phylogenetic information can produce unreliable gene trees (i.e., high error in gene tree estimation), which may in turn reduce the accuracy of species tree estimation using gene-tree-based coalescent methods. We demonstrate that this problem can be alleviated by sampling more genes, as is commonly done in large-scale phylogenomic analyses. This applies even when these genes are minimally informative. If gene tree estimation is biased, however, gene-tree-based coalescent analyses will produce inconsistent results, which cannot be remedied by increasing the number of genes. In this case, it is not the gene-tree-based coalescent methods that are flawed, but rather the input data (i.e., estimated gene trees). Along these lines, the commonly used program PhyML has a tendency to infer one particular bifurcating topology even though it is best represented as a polytomy. We additionally corroborate these findings by analyzing the 183-locus mammal data set assembled by McCormack et al. (2012) using ultra-conserved elements (UCEs) and flanking DNA. Lastly, we demonstrate that when employing the multilocus bootstrap approach on this 183-locus data set, there is no strong conflict between species trees estimated from concatenation and gene-tree-based coalescent analyses, as has been previously suggested by Gatesy and Springer (2014).

27000656,Selection of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in Staphylococcus capitis during growth under erythromycin stress.,"Accurate and reproducible measurement of gene transcription requires appropriate reference genes, which are stably expressed under different experimental conditions to provide normalization. Staphylococcus capitis is a human pathogen that produces biofilm under stress, such as imposed by antimicrobial agents. In this study, a set of five commonly used staphylococcal reference genes (gyrB, sodA, recA, tuf and rpoB) were systematically evaluated in two clinical isolates of Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis subspecies urealyticus and capitis, respectively) under erythromycin stress in mid-log and stationary phases. Two public software programs (geNorm and NormFinder) and two manual calculation methods, reference residue normalization (RRN) and relative quantitative (RQ), were applied. The potential reference genes selected by the four algorithms were further validated by comparing the expression of a well-studied biofilm gene (icaA) with phenotypic biofilm formation in S. capitis under four different experimental conditions. The four methods differed considerably in their ability to predict the most suitable reference gene or gene combination for comparing icaA expression under different conditions. Under the conditions used here, the RQ method provided better selection of reference genes than the other three algorithms; however, this finding needs to be confirmed with a larger number of isolates. This study reinforces the need to assess the stability of reference genes for analysis of target gene expression under different conditions and the use of more than one algorithm in such studies. Although this work was conducted using a specific human pathogen, it emphasizes the importance of selecting suitable reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression more generally.

For this purpose, reverse transcription and quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a powerful tool for gene expression evaluation. For a reliable analysis, however, it is necessary to select and validate housekeeping genes that allow proper transcription quantification. Stability of nine housekeeping genes (ACTB, BGLU, TUBB, CY, GAPDH, HPRTI, RPL5, SDHA and UBC) was evaluated in different tissues of red abalone (gill, head and gonad/digestive gland). Four-fold serial dilutions of cDNA (from 25 ngμL(-1) to 0.39 ngμL(-1)) were used to prepare the standard curve, and it showed gene efficiencies between 0.95 and 0.99, with R(2)=0.99. geNorm and NormFinder analysis showed that RPL5 and CY were the most stable genes considering all tissues, whereas in gill HPRTI and BGLU were most stable. In gonad/digestive gland, RPL5 and TUBB were the most stable genes with geNorm, while SDHA and HPRTI were the best using NormFinder. Similarly, in head the best genes were RPL5 and UBC with geNorm, and GAPDH and CY with NormFinder. The technical variability analysis with RPL5 and abalone gonad/digestive gland tissue indicated a high repeatability with a variation coefficient within groups ≤ 0.56% and between groups ≤ 1.89%.

28849169,Combined analysis of ChIP-seq and gene microarray datasets identify the E2-mediated genes in ERα-dependent manner in osteosarcoma.,"Osteosarcoma is a common bone tumor which is affected by E2, the most representative estrogen. Gene regulation function of E2 is highly dependent on estrogen receptor. The purpose of this study was to explore the gene regulation patterns of E2 through estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in osteosarcoma based on the combined analysis of ChIP-seq and gene microarray. All of the datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differential expression genes (DEGs) in E2 treated U2OS cells expressing ESR1 (U2OS-ERα) compared with those treated with vehicle were obtained based on R programming software. ESR1-specific binding sites (peaks) in E2 treated U2OS cells were identified through MACS. Overlaps between DEGs and ESR1 target genes which contained peaks in promoters were considered as reliable E2-mediated genes through ESR1 in osteosarcoma. Moreover, we conducted miRNA-Gene regulation analysis for those genes through miRWalk database to identify potential therapeutic targets for the genes. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs indicated their potential involvement in cancer, and cell activity-related processes. Fifteen overlaps were identified between DEGs and target genes of ESR1, of which 12 were found to be regulated by miRNA. Several known estrogen response genes and novel genes were obtained in this study and they might provide potential therapeutic targets for osteosarcoma.",2018-07-05,"Binding Sites, Cell Line, Tumor, Estrogen Receptor alpha, Estrogens, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, MicroRNAs, Microarray Analysis, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Osteosarcoma, Promoter Regions, Genetic",Oncol Rep,10.3892/or.2017.5914,Tian
30053121,A Dead Gene Walking: Convergent Degeneration of a Clade of MADS-Box Genes in Crucifers.,"Genes are ""born,"" and eventually they ""die."" These processes shape the phenotypic evolution of organisms and are hence of great biological interest. If genes die in plants, they generally do so quite rapidly. Here, we describe the fate of GOA-like genes that evolve in a dramatically different manner. GOA-like genes belong to the subfamily of Bsister genes of MIKC-type MADS-box genes. Typical MIKC-type genes encode conserved transcription factors controlling plant development. We show that ABS-like genes, a clade of Bsister genes, are indeed highly conserved in crucifers (Brassicaceae) maintaining the ancestral function of Bsister genes in ovule and seed development. In contrast, their closest paralogs, the GOA-like genes, have been undergoing convergent gene death in Brassicaceae. Intriguingly, erosion of GOA-like genes occurred after millions of years of coexistence with ABS-like genes. We thus describe Delayed Convergent Asymmetric Degeneration, a so far neglected but possibly frequent pattern of duplicate gene evolution that does not fit classical scenarios. Delayed Convergent Asymmetric Degeneration of GOA-like genes may have been initiated by a reduction in the expression of an ancestral GOA-like gene in the stem group of Brassicaceae and driven by dosage subfunctionalization. Our findings have profound implications for gene annotations in genomics, interpreting patterns of gene evolution and using genes in phylogeny reconstructions of species.",2019-06-20,"Brassicaceae, Evolution, Molecular, MADS Domain Proteins, Phylogeny, Pseudogenes, Selection, Genetic",Mol Biol Evol,10.1093/molbev/msy142,Hoffmeier

30384160,Selection and validation of reference genes for target gene analysis with quantitative real-time PCR in the leaves and roots of Carex rigescens under abiotic stress.,"Carex rigescens is an ornamental turfgrass in northern China which has a relatively low maintenance cost and robust tolerance to many adverse environmental conditions, so it could be considered a new material for researching into plant stress resistance. However, suitable reference genes are vacant for obtaining reliable results in quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of C. rigescens in adversity research. In this study, we tested the expression stability of nine potential reference genes in leaves and roots under five different abiotic stress conditions, including cold, salt, heat, osmotic and cadmium (Cd). We then selected the best reference genes according to the analysis results calculated by three algorithmic programs (geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) and used the RankAggreg package to merge the outputted data. The results showed that combinations of at least two reference genes should be used for reliable normalization except in heat-treated root samples, which require three reference genes. eIF-4α, GADPH, SAND and PEPKR1 and their combination were found to be the most stably expressed reference genes, while SAM, TUA-α and UPL7 were the three least stable reference genes among most of experimental samples. In addition, five stress-induced genes (Cu-Zn SOD, P5CS, LEA, GST, and APX) were chosen to verify the stability of the selected reference genes in various tissues and under various stress conditions. The results of this study will provide an important fundamental basis both for gene expression verification for transcriptomic and proteomic analyses and for gene expression analysis for future gene function research in C. rigescens.",2019-01-18,"Cyperaceae, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Plant Leaves, Plant Roots, Proteomics, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Selection, Genetic, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.10.049,Zhang
31615113,D-GPM: A Deep Learning Method for Gene Promoter Methylation Inference.,"Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing generates a comprehensive profiling of the gene methylation levels, but is limited by a high cost. Recent studies have partitioned the genes into landmark genes and target genes and suggested that the landmark gene expression levels capture adequate information to reconstruct the target gene expression levels. This inspired us to propose that the methylation level of the promoters in landmark genes might be adequate to reconstruct the promoter methylation level of target genes, which would eventually reduce the cost of promoter methylation profiling. Here, we propose a deep learning model called Deep-Gene Promoter Methylation (D-GPM) to predict the whole-genome promoter methylation level based on the promoter methylation profile of the landmark genes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). D-GPM-15%-7000 × 5, the optimal architecture of D-GPM, acquires the least overall mean absolute error (MAE) and the highest overall Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC), with values of 0.0329 and 0.8186, respectively, when testing data. Additionally, the D-GPM outperforms the regression tree (RT), linear regression (LR), and the support vector machine (SVM) in 95.66%, 92.65%, and 85.49% of the target genes by virtue of its relatively lower MAE and in 98.25%, 91.00%, and 81.56% of the target genes based on its relatively higher PCC, respectively. More importantly, the D-GPM predominates in predicting 79.86% and 78.34% of the target genes according to the model distribution of the least MAE and the highest PCC, respectively.",2020-03-20,"Computational Biology, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, Deep Learning, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Humans, Linear Models, Machine Learning, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Sequence Analysis, DNA",Genes (Basel),,Pan
31318935,A comprehensive expression analysis of the expansin gene family in potato (Solanum tuberosum) discloses stress-responsive expansin-like B genes for drought and heat tolerances.,"Expansin is a type of cell wall elongation and stress relaxation protein involved in various developmental processes and stress resistances in plant. In this study, we identified 36 potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) genes belonging to the expansin (StEXP) gene family from the genome reference. These genes included 24 α-expansins (StEXPAs), five β-expansins (StEXPBs), one expansin-like A (StEXLA) and six expansin-like B (StEXLBs). The RNA-Seq analysis conducted from a variety of tissue types showed 34 expansins differentially expressed among tissues, some of which only expressed in specific tissues. Most of the StEXPAs and StEXPB2 transcripts were more abundant in young tuber compared with other tissues, suggesting they likely play a role in tuber development. There were 31 genes, especially StEXLB6, showed differential expression under the treatments of ABA, IAA and GA3, as well as under the drought and heat stresses, indicating they were likely involved in potato stress resistance. In addition, the gene co-expression analysis indicated the StEXLBs likely contribute to a wider range of stress resistances compared with other genes. We found the StEXLA and six StEXLBs expressed differently under a range of abiotic stresses (salt, alkaline, heavy metals, drought, heat, and cold stresses), which likely participated in the associated signaling pathways. Comparing with the control group, potato growing under the drought or heat stresses exhibited up-regulation of the all six StEXLB genes in leaves, whereas, the StEXLB3, StEXLB4, StEXLB5 and StEXLB6 showed relatively higher expression levels in roots. This suggested these genes likely played a role in the drought and heat tolerance. Overall, this study has shown the potential role of the StEXP genes in potato growth and stress tolerance, and provided fundamental resources for the future studies in potato breeding.",2020-03-02,"Chromosomes, Plant, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Genome, Plant, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genomics, Multigene Family, Phylogeny, Plant Growth Regulators, Solanum tuberosum, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome",PLoS One,,Chen

31590243,"Patterns and Constraints in the Evolution of Sperm Individualization Genes in Insects, with an Emphasis on Beetles.","Gene expression profiles can change dramatically between sexes and sex bias may contribute specific macroevolutionary dynamics for sex-biased genes. However, these dynamics are poorly understood at large evolutionary scales due to the paucity of studies that have assessed orthology and functional homology for sex-biased genes and the pleiotropic effects possibly constraining their evolutionary potential. Here, we explore the correlation of sex-biased expression with macroevolutionary processes that are associated with sex-biased genes, including duplications and accelerated evolutionary rates. Specifically, we examined these traits in a group of 44 genes that orchestrate sperm individualization during spermatogenesis, with both unbiased and sex-biased expression. We studied these genes in the broad evolutionary framework of the Insecta, with a particular focus on beetles (order Coleoptera). We studied data mined from 119 insect genomes, including 6 beetle models, and from 19 additional beetle transcriptomes. For the subset of physically and/or genetically interacting proteins, we also analyzed how their network structure may condition the mode of gene evolution. The collection of genes was highly heterogeneous in duplication status, evolutionary rates, and rate stability, but there was statistical evidence for sex bias correlated with faster evolutionary rates, consistent with theoretical predictions. Faster rates were also correlated with clocklike (insect amino acids) and non-clocklike (beetle nucleotides) substitution patterns in these genes. Statistical associations (higher rates for central nodes) or lack thereof (centrality of duplicated genes) were in contrast to some current evolutionary hypotheses, highlighting the need for more research on these topics.",2020-03-20,"Animals, Coleoptera, Databases, Genetic, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Insect, Insecta, Male, Phylogeny, Sex Characteristics, Spermatogenesis, Spermatozoa, Transcriptome",Genes (Basel),,Vizán-Rico

30576803,Transcriptomic and evolutionary analyses of white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) β-amylase genes reveals their importance for cold and drought stress responses.,"β-amylase (BAM) genes play essential roles in plant abiotic stress responses. Although the genome of Chinese white pear (Pyrus bretschneideri) has recently been made available, knowledge regarding the BAM family in pear, including gene function, evolutionary history and patterns of gene expression remains limited. In this study, we identified 17 PbBAMs in the pear genome. Of these, 12 PbBAM members were mapped onto 9 chromosomes and 5 PbBAM genes were located on scaffold contigs. Based on gene structure, protein motif analysis, and the topology of the phylogenetic tree of the PbBAM family, we classified member genes into 4 groups. All PbBAM genes were found to contain typical glycosyl hydrolysis 14 domain motifs. Interfamilial comparisons revealed that the phylogenetic relationships of BAM genes in other Rosaceae species were similar those found in pear. We also found that whole-genome duplication (WGD)/segmental duplication events played critical roles in the expansion of the BAM family. Next, we used transcriptomic data to study gene expression during the response of drought and low temperate responses, and found that genes in Group B were related to drought and cold stress. We identified four PbBAM genes associated with abiotic stress in Pear. Finally, by analyzing co-expression networks and co-regulatory genes, we found that PbBAM1a and PbBAM1b were associated with the pear abiotic stress response.",2019-02-07,"Acclimatization, Cold Temperature, Cold-Shock Response, Droughts, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Multigene Family, Phylogeny, Pyrus, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome, beta-Amylase",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.092,Zhao

31783262,Identification of mimp-associated effector genes in Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 1 and race 4 and virulence confirmation of a candidate effector gene.,"Effectors secreted by microbes contribute to pathogen virulence and/or avirulence on host plants in the interaction of plants and microbes. Also, the effector repertoire determines the host specificity of a pathogen. Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc) is the causal agent of banana wilt; however, knowledge about Foc effector genes is very limited. In this study, genome-wide effector gene identification was performed in Foc race 1 (Foc 1) and Foc race 4 (Foc 4) based on the context association between the effector genes and the transposable element mimp. A total of 20 candidate effector genes were identified, of which 3 were Foc 1-specific, 6 were Foc 4-specific, and 11 were present in both Foc 1 and Foc 4. Most genes (14 out of 20) showed a significant transcriptional burst in planta compared with in-culture conditions, from more than 10-fold to 1,617-fold, and at the highest 32,725-fold. In addition to Foc 1- and Foc 4-specific genes, the genes Foc 283, Foc 495, and Foc 594 also exhibited transcriptional race specificity. Sixteen of the twenty genes were predicted to have a signal peptide, nine genes might encode real effectors predicted by EffectorP 2.0, and eight genes had predicted motifs. To validate the pathogenicity of the candidate effector genes, we generated knockout mutant and complementants of the gene Foc 1324 and tested their virulence on banana plants.

The selection of appropriate reference genes plays a critical role in the outcome of such experiments as the method quantifies expression of the target gene in comparison with the reference. Traditionally most commonly used reference genes are the ""house-keeping genes"", involved in basic cellular processes. However, expression levels of such genes often vary in response to experimental conditions, forcing the researchers to validate the reference genes for every experimental platform.

25058012,Identification of differentially expressed genes in flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) under saline-alkaline stress by digital gene expression.,"The salinization and alkalization of soil are widespread environmental problems, and alkaline salt stress is more destructive than neutral salt stress. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of plant tolerance to saline-alkaline stress has become a major challenge. However, little attention has been paid to the mechanism of plant alkaline salt tolerance. In this study, gene expression profiling of flax was analyzed under alkaline-salt stress (AS2), neutral salt stress (NSS) and alkaline stress (AS) by digital gene expression. Three-week-old flax seedlings were placed in 25 mM Na2CO3 (pH11.6) (AS2), 50mM NaCl (NSS) and NaOH (pH11.6) (AS) for 18 h. There were 7736, 1566 and 454 differentially expressed genes in AS2, NSS and AS compared to CK, respectively. The GO category gene enrichment analysis revealed that photosynthesis was particularly affected in AS2, carbohydrate metabolism was particularly affected in NSS, and the response to biotic stimulus was particularly affected in AS. We also analyzed the expression pattern of five categories of genes including transcription factors, signaling transduction proteins, phytohormones, reactive oxygen species proteins and transporters under these three stresses. Some key regulatory gene families involved in abiotic stress, such as WRKY, MAPKKK, ABA, PrxR and ion channels, were differentially expressed. Compared with NSS and AS, AS2 triggered more differentially expressed genes and special pathways, indicating that the mechanism of AS2 was more complex than NSS and AS. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first transcriptome analysis of flax in response to saline-alkaline stress. These data indicate that common and diverse features of saline-alkaline stress provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of plant saline-alkaline tolerance and offer a number of candidate genes as potential markers of tolerance to saline-alkaline stress.",2014-10-21,"Carbonates, Flax, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Photosynthesis, RNA, Plant, Seedlings, Sodium Chloride, Sodium Hydroxide, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2014.07.053,Yu
31136746,Identification of a new panel of reference genes to study pairing-dependent gene expression in Schistosoma mansoni.,"Facilitated by the Schistosoma mansoni genome project, multiple transcriptomic studies were performed over the last decade to elucidate gene expression patterns among different developmental stages of the complex schistosome life cycle. While these analyses enable the identification of candidate genes with key functions in schistosome biology, a diverse molecular tool set is needed that allows comprehensive functional characterization at the single gene level. This includes the availability of reliable reference genes to confirm changes in the transcription of genes of interest over different biological samples and experimental conditions. In particular, the investigation of one key aspect of schistosome biology, the pairing-dependent gene expression in females and males, requires knowledge on reference genes that are expressed independently of both pairing and of in vitro culture effects. Therefore, the present study focused on the identification of quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR reference genes suitable for the investigation of pairing-dependent gene expression in the S. mansoni male. The ""pipeline"" we present here is based on qRT-PCR analyses of high biological replication combined with three different statistical analysis tools, BestKeeper, geNorm, and NormFinder. Our approach resulted in a statistically robust ranking of 15 selected reference genes with respect to their transcription stability between pairing-unexperienced and -experienced males. We further tested the top seven candidate genes for their transcription stability during invitro culture of adult S. mansoni. Of these, the two most suitable reference genes were used to investigate the influence of the pairing contact on the transcription of genes of interest, comprising a tyrosine decarboxylase gene Smtdc1, an ebony ortholog Smebony, and the follistatin ortholog Smfst in S. mansoni males. Performing pairing, separation and re-pairing experiments with adult S. mansoni in vitro, our results indicate for the first time that pairing can act as a molecular on/off-switch of specific genes to strictly control their expression in schistosome males.",2020-04-28,"Algorithms, Animals, Biomphalaria, Cricetinae, Female, Gene Expression, Male, Mesocricetus, RNA, Helminth, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Values, Schistosoma mansoni",Int J Parasitol,10.1016/j.ijpara.2019.01.006,Haeberlein

In order to identify stable and reliable reference genes in Trichoderma afroharzianum under oxalic acid (OA) stress, six commonly used housekeeping genes, i.e., elongation factor 1, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, α-tubulin, actin, from the effective biocontrol isolate T. afroharzianum strain LTR-2 were tested for their expression during growth in liquid culture amended with OA. Four in silico programs (comparative ΔCt, NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stabilities of six candidate reference genes. The elongation factor 1 gene EF-1 was identified as the most stably expressed reference gene, and was used as the normalizer to quantify the expression level of the oxalate decarboxylase coding gene OXDC in T. afroharzianum strain LTR-2 under OA stress. The result showed that the expression of OXDC was significantly up-regulated as expected.

Gene expression profile of GSE26316, generated from 3 SINFH rat samples and 3 normal rat samples were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using LIMMA package. After functional enrichment analyses of DEGs, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sub-PPI network analyses were conducted based on the STRING database and cytoscape. In total, 59 up-regulated DEGs and 156 downregulated DEGs were identified. The up-regulated DEGs were mainly involved in functions about immunity (e.g. Fcer1A and Il7R), and the downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in muscle system process (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1). The PPI network of DEGs consisted of 123 nodes and 300 interactions. Tnni2, Mylpf, and Myl1 were the top 3 outstanding genes based on both subgraph centrality and degree centrality evaluation. These three genes interacted with each other in the network. Furthermore, the significant network module was composed of 22 downregulated genes (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1). These genes were mainly enriched in functions like muscle system process. The DEGs related to the regulation of immune system process (e.g. Fcer1A and Il7R), and DEGs correlated with muscle system process (e.g. Tnni2, Mylpf and Myl1) may be closely associated with the progress of SINFH, which is still needed to be confirmed by experiments.",2017-09-20,"Animals, Femur Head Necrosis, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Rats, Steroids, Transcriptome",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.05.026,Lin
31715627,Selection of reference genes for normalization of cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon Ait.) gene expression under different experimental conditions.,"Real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) is often chosen as an effective experimental method for analyzing gene expression. However, an appropriate reference gene as a standard is needed to obtain accurate gene expression data. To date, no internal reference genes have been reported for research on cranberries. Expanding the selection of internal reference genes for cranberry will enable reliable gene expression analysis, and, at the same time, can also lay a solid foundation for revealing the biological characteristics of cranberry. Here, we selected ten candidate reference gene families and used three statistical software tools-geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper-to evaluate their expression stability under the influence of different experimental factors. The results showed that protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit (PP2A) or RNA helicase-like 8 (RH 8) was the best choice for an internal reference gene when analyzing different cranberry cultivars. In two sample sets comprising different cranberry organs and three abiotic stress treatments, sand family protein (SAND) was the best choice as a reference gene. In this study, we screened genes that are stably expressed under the influence of various experimental factors by qRT-PCR.

28046130,"Evaluation of Reference Genes for Normalization of Gene Expression Using Quantitative RT-PCR under Aluminum, Cadmium, and Heat Stresses in Soybean.","Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used to analyze the relative gene expression level, however, the accuracy of qRT-PCR is greatly affected by the stability of reference genes, which is tissue- and environment- dependent. Therefore, choosing the most stable reference gene in a specific tissue and environment is critical to interpret gene expression patterns. Aluminum (Al), cadmium (Cd), and heat stresses are three important abiotic factors limiting soybean (Glycine max) production in southern China. To identify the suitable reference genes for normalizing the expression levels of target genes by qRT-PCR in soybean response to Al, Cd and heat stresses, we studied the expression stability of ten commonly used housekeeping genes in soybean roots and leaves under these three abiotic stresses, using five approaches, BestKeeper, Delta Ct, geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder. We found TUA4 is the most stable reference gene in soybean root tips under Al stress. Under Cd stress, Fbox and UKN2 are the most stable reference genes in roots and leaves, respectively, while 60S is the most suitable reference gene when analyzing both roots and leaves together. For heat stress, TUA4 and UKN2 are the most stable housekeeping genes in roots and leaves, respectively, and UKN2 is the best reference gene for analysis of roots and leaves together. To validate the reference genes, we quantified the relative expression levels of six target genes that were involved in soybean response to Al, Cd or heat stresses, respectively. The expression patterns of these target genes differed between using the most and least stable reference genes, suggesting the selection of a suitable reference gene is critical for gene expression studies.",2017-09-06,"Aluminum, Cadmium, China, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Hot Temperature, Plant Proteins, Plant Roots, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Soybeans, Stress, Physiological",PLoS One,,Gao
29880849,Validation of Common Housekeeping Genes as Reference for qPCR Gene Expression Analysis During iPS Reprogramming Process.,"Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS) reprogramming allows to turn a differentiated somatic cell into a pluripotent cell. This process is accompanied by many changes in fundamental cell properties, such as energy production, cell-to-cell interactions, cytoskeletal organization, and others. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) can be used as a quantitative method of gene expression analysis to investigate iPS reprogramming but it requires a validation of reference genes for the accurate assessment of target genes' expression. Currently, studies evaluating the performance of reference genes during iPS reprogramming are lacking. In this study we analysed the stability of 12 housekeeping genes during 20 days of iPS reprogramming of murine cells based on statistical analyses of RT-qPCR data using five different statistical algorithms. This study reports strong variations in housekeeping gene stability during the reprogramming process. Most stable genes were Atp5f1, Pgk1 and Gapdh, while the least stable genes were Rps18, Hprt, Tbp and Actb. The results were validated by a proof-of-point qPCR experiment with pluripotent markers Nanog, Rex1 and Oct4 normalized to the best and the worst reference gene identified by the analyses.

The gene expression profiles were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and 6 datasets, of which 2 were discarded and 4 were retained, were preprocessed using packages in the R computing language. Subsequently, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and meta-analysis was used to screen the common pathways and differentially expressed genes at the transcriptional level. The genes detected from GSEA through The Cancer Genome Atlas databases were subsequently examined, and the crucial genes by survival data were identified. Pathways of the crucial genes were obtained using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway of the online website Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool, and the pathways of crucial genes that were upregulated or downregulated were matched using the Venn method to identify the common crucial pathways. Furthermore, on the basis of the common crucial pathways, key genes that are closely associated with the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma were identified with the KEGG pathway of DAVID. Additional information was obtained through Gene Ontology annotation. A total of two key pathways, including cell cycle and DNA replication, as well as 12 key genes [DNA polymerase δ subunit 2, DNA replication licensing factor MCM4, MCM6, mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine-protein kinase BUB1, BUB1β, mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint protein MAD2A, dual specificity protein kinase TTK, M-phase inducer phosphatase 1, cell division control protein 45 homolog, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C, pituitary tumor-transforming gene 1 protein and polo-like kinase 1] were identified. These key pathways and genes may be studied in future studies involving gene transfection/knockdown, which may provide insights into the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Additional studies are required to confirm their biological function.",,,Oncol Lett,,He

A systematic study of such interactions obviously contributes to the development of new methods of diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disorders, as the orientation to allele variants of individual loci is not reliable enough, because the literature describes a number of genes, the same alleles of which can be associated with different, sometimes extremely different variants of phenotypic traits, depending on the genetic background, of their carriers, habitat, and other factors.",2020-01-16,"Anxiety, Depression, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Intellectual Disability, Neurotransmitter Agents, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Protein Interaction Maps, Synaptic Transmission",Genes (Basel),,Ivanov
23792389,Evaluation of reference genes for quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of gene expression in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).,"Quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has been used frequently to study gene expression related to fish immunology. In such studies, a stable reference gene should be selected to correct the expression of the target gene. In this study, seven candidate reference genes (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UBCE), 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1A), tubulin alpha chain-like (TUBA) and beta actin (ACTB)), were selected to analyze their stability and normalization in seven tissues (liver, spleen, kidney, brain, heart, muscle and intestine) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) challenged with Streptococcus agalactiae or Streptococcus iniae, respectively. The results showed that all the candidate reference genes exhibited tissue-dependent transcriptional variations. With PBS injection as a control, UBCE was the most stable and suitable single reference gene in the intestine, liver, brain, kidney, and spleen after S. iniae infection, and in the liver, kidney, and spleen after S. agalactiae infection. EF1A was the most suitable in heart and muscle after S. iniae or S. agalactiae infection. GADPH was the most suitable gene in intestine and brain after S. agalactiae infection. In normal conditions, UBCE and 18S rRNA were the most stably expressed genes across the various tissues. These results showed that for RT-qPCR analysis of tilapia, selecting two or more reference genes may be more suitable for cross-tissue analysis of gene expression.

31805178,Selection and validation of reference genes desirable for gene expression analysis by qRT-PCR in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots.,"Ginseng is a valuable herb of traditional Chinese medicine and ginsenosides, the main bioactive components of ginseng, have been proven to have multiple functions in human therapies and health. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) is an elicitor that has been demonstrated to have a vital influence on ginsenoside biosynthesis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) has been widely used in quantification of gene expressions. Here, we report the selection and validation of reference genes desirable for normalization of gene expressions quantified by qRT-PCR in ginseng hairy roots treated with MeJA. Twelve reference genes were selected as candidate genes, and their expressions were quantified by qRT-PCR, and analyzed by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. CYP and EF-1α were shown to be the most stable reference genes in geNorm, CYP was the most stable reference gene in NormFinder, and 18S was the most stable reference gene in BestKeeper. On this basis, we further quantified the relative expression levels of four genes encoding key enzymes that are involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis using CYP and 18S as the reference genes, respectively. Moreover, correlation analysis was performed between the quantified expressions of four genes and the ginsenoside content in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. The results of relative expressions of the four genes quantified using CYP as the reference gene and their significant correlations with the ginsenoside content were better than those using 18S as the reference gene. The CYP gene, hence, was concluded as the most desirable reference gene for quantification of the expressions of genes in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots. This finding, therefore, provides information useful for gene research in ginseng, particularly in MeJA-treated ginseng hairy roots, which includes identification and characterization of genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis.",2020-03-30,"Acetates, Cyclopentanes, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Ginsenosides, Oxylipins, Panax, Plant Proteins, Plant Roots, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards",PLoS One,,Li
24631263,Identification of rice genes associated with cosmic-ray response via co-expression gene network analysis.,"In order to better understand the biological systems that are affected in response to cosmic ray (CR), we conducted weighted gene co-expression network analysis using the module detection method. By using the Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) value, we evaluated complex gene-gene functional interactions between 680 CR-responsive probes from integrated microarray data sets, which included large-scale transcriptional profiling of 1000 microarray samples. These probes were divided into 6 distinct modules that contained 20 enriched gene ontology (GO) functions, such as oxidoreductase activity, hydrolase activity, and response to stimulus and stress. In particular, modules 1 and 2 commonly showed enriched annotation categories such as oxidoreductase activity, including enriched cis-regulatory elements known as ROS-specific regulators. These results suggest that the ROS-mediated irradiation response pathway is affected by CR in modules 1 and 2. We found 243 ionizing radiation (IR)-responsive probes that exhibited similarities in expression patterns in various irradiation microarray data sets. The expression patterns of 6 randomly selected IR-responsive genes were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction following treatment with CR, gamma rays (GR), and ion beam (IB); similar patterns were observed among these genes under these 3 treatments. Moreover, we constructed subnetworks of IR-responsive genes and evaluated the expression levels of their neighboring genes following GR treatment; similar patterns were observed among them. These results of network-based analyses might provide a clue to understanding the complex biological system related to the CR response in plants.

It uses novel reference network-based metrices for module evolution. These could be used to identify module of highly connected genes showing variation in co-expression network. In this study, a co-expression network-based approach was used for analyzing the genes from microarray data. Our approach consists of a simple but robust rank-based network construction. The publicly available gene expression data of Solanum tuberosum under cold and heat stresses were considered to create and analyze a gene co-expression network. The analysis provide highly co-expressed module of bHLH coding genes based on correlation values. Our approach was to analyze the variation of genes expression, according to the time period of stress through co-expression network approach. As the result, the seed genes were identified showing multiple connections with other genes in the same cluster. Seed genes were found to be vary in different time periods of stress.

Gene amplification is a major event in oncogenesis. Driver genes with tumor-specific amplification-dependent overexpression can be therapeutic targets. In this study, we aimed to identify amplification-dependent driver genes in 1,454 solid tumors, across more than 15 cancer types, by integrative analysis of gene expression and copy number. Amplification-dependent overexpression of 64 known driver oncogenes were found in 587 tumors (40%); genes frequently observed were MYC (25%) and MET (18%) in colorectal cancer; SKP2 (21%) in lung squamous cell carcinoma; HIST1H3B (19%) and MYCN (13%) in liver cancer; KIT (57%) in gastrointestinal stromal tumors; and FOXL2 (12%) in squamous cell carcinoma across tissues. Genomic aberrations in 138 known cancer driver genes and 491 established fusion genes were found in 1,127 tumors (78%). Further analyses of 820 cancer-related genes revealed 16 as potential driver genes, with amplification-dependent overexpression restricted to the remaining 22% of samples (327 tumors) initially undetermined genetic drivers.

31297694,Genome-wide identification of internal reference genes for normalization of gene expression values during endosperm development in wheat.,"Internal reference genes that are stably expressed are essential for normalization in comparative expression analyses. However, gene expression varies significantly among species, organisms, tissues, developmental stages, stresses, and treatments. Therefore, identification of stably expressed reference genes in developmental endosperm of bread wheat is important for expression analysis of endosperm genes. As the first study to systematically screen for reference genes across different developmental stages of wheat endosperm, nine genes were selected from among 76 relatively stable genes based on high-throughput RNA sequencing data. The expression stability of these candidate genes and five traditional reference genes was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR combined with three independent algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results showed that ATG8d was the most stable gene during wheat endosperm development, followed by Ta54227, while the housekeeping gene GAPDH, commonly used as an internal reference, was the least stable. ATG8d and Ta54227 together formed the optimal combination of reference genes. Comparative expression analysis of glutenin genes indicated that credible quantification could be achieved by normalization against ATG8d in developmental endosperm. The stably expressed gene characterized here can act as a proper internal reference for expression analysis of wheat endosperm genes, especially nutrient- and nutrient synthesis-related genes.",2020-02-10,"Algorithms, Endosperm, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Plant Development, Reference Standards, Triticum",J Appl Genet,,Mu
27794441,The glpD gene is a novel reporter gene for E. coli that is superior to established reporter genes like lacZ and gusA.,"Reporter genes facilitate the characterization of promoter activities, transcript stabilities, translational efficiencies, or intracellular localization. Various reporter genes for Escherichia coli have been established, however, most of them have drawbacks like transcript instability or the inability to be used in genetic selections. Therefore, the glpD gene encoding glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was introduced as a novel reporter gene for E. coli. The enzymatic assay was optimized, and it was verified that growth on glycerol strictly depends on the presence of GlpD. The 5'-UTRs of three E. coli genes were chosen and cloned upstream of the new reporter gene glpD as well as the established reporter genes lacZ and gusA. Protein and transcript levels were quantified and translational efficiencies were calculated. The lacZ transcript was very unstable and its level highly depended on its translation, compromising its use as a reporter. The results obtained with gusA and glpD were similar, however, only glpD can be used for genetic selections. Therefore, glpD was found to be a superior novel reporter gene compared to the established reporter genes lacZ and gusA.",2017-09-21,"Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Bacterial, Enzyme Assays, Escherichia coli, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Gene Fusion, Genes, Bacterial, Genes, Reporter, Glycerol, Glycerolphosphate Dehydrogenase, Lac Operon, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Transcription, Genetic",J Microbiol Methods,10.1016/j.mimet.2016.10.015,Wegener
31099776,[Homeotic DUX4 Genes that Control Human Embryonic Development at the Two-Cell Stage Are Surrounded by Regions Contacting with rDNA Gene Clusters].,"Many human genes that control human embryonic development and differentiation of human cells form chromosomal contact with rRNA gene clusters, which are involved in the epigenetic regulation of many genes. The sites of rRNA gene contact often fall on extended (up to 50 kb) regions containing a chromatin mark, H3K27ac histone, typical for superenhancers, as well as on pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions of chromosomes. We found that the DUX4 genes located in the subtelomeric region of human chromosome 4 are surrounded by regions that are often in contact with the rRNA genes. The 25 kb region of this chromosome, presented in version hg19 of the sequenced human genome, contains several copies of the DUX4 gene. The sites of rRNA gene contacts located around this region contain methylation sites as well as CTCF binding sites.

31145453,Evaluation of Appropriate Reference Genes For Investigating Gene Expression in Chlorops oryzae (Diptera: Chloropidae).,"Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become an invaluable technique for analyzing gene expression in many insects. However, this approach requires the use of stable reference genes to normalize the data. Chlorops oryzae causes significant economic damage to rice crops throughout Asia. The lack of suitable reference genes has hindered research on the molecular mechanisms underlying many physiological processes of this species. In this study, we used quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate the expression of eight C. oryzae housekeeping genes glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-actin (βACT), beta-tubulin (βTUB), Delta Elongation factor-1 (EF1δ), ribosomal protein S11 (RPS11), RPS15, C-terminal-Binding Protein (CtBP), and ribosomal protein 49 (RP49) in different developmental stages and tissues in both larvae and adults. We analyzed the data with four different software packages: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder and compared the results obtained with each method. The results indicate that PRS15 and RP49 can be used as stable reference genes for quantifying gene expression in different developmental stages and larval tissues. GAPDH and βACT, which have been considered stable reference genes by previous studies, were the least stable of the candidate genes with respect to larval tissues. GAPDH was, however, the most stable reference gene for adult tissues. We verified the candidate reference genes identified and found that the expression levels of Cadherins (Cads) changed when different reference genes were used to normalize gene expression.

30107230,Identification of Skt11-regulated genes in chondrocytes by integrated bioinformatics analysis.,"SKT11, an important tumor suppressor, is a member of the serine/threonine kinase family and plays a crucial role in tumor invasion and metastasis by activated adenine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and AMPK-related kinase proteins. However, few studies have elaborated its regulations of development and metabolism of cartilage, as well as skeleton. This study was aimed to investigate the role of Stk11-knockout in chondrocyte by bioinformatics analysis. The gene expression profiles for Stk11-knockout and wild-type mice were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A total of 1104 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by Affymetrix Expression Console and Transcriptome Analysis Console (TAC) software, including 560 up-regulated and 544 down-regulated genes. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were built by mapping DEGs into STRING, in which hub genes such as Fos, Pdgfrb, Pdgfra, Flt1/Vegfr1, Smad3, Mapk14, Twist and Aurkb were further identified. For the up-regulated genes, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and Wnt signaling pathway were two main pathways in the KEGG analysis, and ossification and extracellular matrix organization were involved in the Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. On the other hand, the down-regulated genes were mainly involved in systemic lupus erythematosus and alcoholism pathways, and B cell receptor signaling pathway and immune system process biological processes. MiRNA-9, miRNA-134, miRNA-492, miRNA-224 and miRNA-142-5p were identified as key regulators in the miRNAs-DEG regulatory network. Additionally, OSF2/RUNX2, and NFAT regulated DEGs collectively in the transcription factor regulatory network.

30110648,Identification and expression profiling of all Hsp family member genes under salinity stress in different poplar clones.,"Heat shock proteins (Hsps) play a key role for regulation of the changes during different stress conditions including salinity, drought, heavy metal and extreme temperature. Molecular based studies on the response mechanisms of forest trees to abiotic stresses started in 2006 when Populus trichocarpa genome sequence was completed as a model tree species. In recent years, bioinformatic analyzes have been carried out to determine functional gene regions of tree species. In this study, sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members were identified in poplar genome. Some bioinformatics analyses were conducted, such as: identification of DNA/protein sequences, chromosomal localization, gene structure, calculation of genomic duplications, determination of phylogenetic groups, examination of protected motif regions, identification of gene ontology categories, modeling of protein 3D structure, determination of miRNA targeting genes, examination of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp90 and Hsp100 gene family members in transcriptome data during salinity stress. As a result of bioinformatic analyzes made on P. trichocarpa genome; 60, 145, 49, 34, 12 and 90 genes belonging to members of sHsp, Hsp40, Hsp60, Hsp70, Hsp90 and Hsp100 protein families were firstly defined within the scope of this study. A total of 390 genes belonging to all Hsps gene families were characterized using different bioinformatics tools. In addition, salinity stress was applied to Populus tremula L. (Samsun) naturally grown in Turkey, Hybrid poplar species I-214 (Populus euramericana Dode. Guinier) and Black Poplar species (Populus nigra L.), Geyve and N.03.368.A clones. The expression levels of the selected Hsps genes were determined by the qRT-PCR method. After salt stress application in various poplar clones, expression levels of genes including PtsHsp-11, PtsHsp-21, PtsHsp-36, PtHsp40-113, PtHsp40-117, PtHsp60-31, PtHsp60-33, PtHsp60-38, PtHsp60-49, PtHsp70-09, PtHsp70-12, 33, PtHsp90-09, PtHsp90-12, PtHsp100-21, and PtHsp100-75 were increased. The role of the Hsps genes during salt stress has been revealed. Together with detailed bioinformatics analyses, gene expression analysis greatly contributes to understand functions of these gene family members.

C. korshinskii has highly developed roots and a strong tolerance to abiotic stress. At present, there are few genetic studies of C. korshinskii because of the limited availability of genomic resources. To understand the comprehensive mechanisms that are associated with drought tolerance, we used RNA-seq to survey the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in comparisons of drought-treated and control plants. After analysing the sequencing results, we found 440 differentially expressed genes existing in drought-treated and control plants. Among the DEGs, 39 unigenes showed up-regulated expression after drought treatment, while 401 unigenes were down-regulated. We used the KEGG database to annotate these drought-induced genes; 126 unigenes were identified by KEGG pathway annotation, and approximately 28% of the unigenes with known function fell into categories related to fatty acid metabolism, starch, sucrose metabolism, and nitrogen metabolism, suggesting that these pathways or processes may be involved in the drought response. Finally, we confirmed that one gene has a potential function in drought tolerance. Our study is the first to provide transcriptomic resources for Caragana korshinskii and to determine its digital gene expression profile under conditions of drought stress using the assembled transcriptomic data for reference.

30772522,Curation and bioinformatic analysis of strabismus genes supports functional heterogeneity and proposes candidate genes with connections to RASopathies.,"Strabismus refers to the misalignment of the eyes and occurs in 2-4% of individuals. The low-resolution label ""strabismus"" covers a range of heterogeneous defects, which makes it challenging to unravel this condition. Consequently a coherent understanding of the causes is lacking. Here, we attempt to gain a better understanding of the underlying genetics by combining gene curation, diverse bioinformatic analyses (including gene ontology, pathway mapping, expression and network-based methods) and literature review. Through a phenotype-based curation process, we identify high-confidence and permissive sets of 54 and 233 genes potentially involved in strabismus. These genes can be grouped into 10 modules that together span a heterogeneous set of biological and molecular functions, and can be linked to clinical sub-phenotypes. Multiple lines of evidence associate retina and cerebellum biology with the strabismus genes. We further highlight a potential role of the Ras-MAPK pathway. Independently, sets of 11 genes and 15 loci tied to strabismus with definitive genetic basis have been compiled from the literature. We identify strabismus candidate genes for 5 of the 15 reported loci (CHD7; SLC9A6; COL18A1, COL6A2; FRY, BRCA2, SPG20; PARK2). Finally, we synthesize a Strabismus Candidate Gene Collection, which together with our curated gene sets will serve as a resource for future research.

The CYP2 gene clusters were characterized and designated CYP2N22-23, CYP2AD12, and CYP2P16-20. Gene synteny analysis confirmed that the cluster in K. marmoratus is similar to that found in other teleost fishes, including zebrafish. A gene duplication event with diverged catalytic function was observed in CYP2AD12. Moreover, a high level of divergence in expression was observed among the co-localized genes. Phylogeny of the cluster suggested an orthologous relationship with similar genes in zebrafish and Japanese medaka. Gene expression analysis showed that CYP2P19 and CYP2N20 were consecutively expressed throughout embryonic development, whereas CYP2P18 was expressed in all adult tissues, suggesting that members of each CYP2 gene family have different physiological roles even though they are located in the same cluster. Among endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P) induced expression of CYP2N23, bisphenol A (BPA) induced CYP2P18 and CYP2P19, and 4-octylphenol (OP) induced CYP2AD12, but there was no significant response to 4-nonylphenol (NP), implying differential catalytic roles of the enzyme. In this paper, we identify and characterize a CYP2 gene cluster in the mangrove killifish K. marmoratus with differing catalytic roles toward EDCs. Our findings provide insights on the roles of nine co-localized CYP2 genes and their catalytic functions for better understanding of chemical-biological interactions in fish.",2017-09-07,"Animals, Benzhydryl Compounds, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, Endocrine Disruptors, Gene Expression, Genome-Wide Association Study, Killifishes, Multigene Family, Phenols, Phylogeny, Species Specificity, Synteny, Water Pollutants, Chemical",Aquat Toxicol,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.03.022,Puthumana

31926587,Identification of hub genes and regulators associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma based on integrated gene expression profile analysis.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most lethal malignancies without effective screening strategy during the early stage. Therefore, a novel screening panel was identified based on potential biomarkers associated with PDAC using the gene expression profile. The dataset GSE15471, which was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, included matching pairs of normal and tumor tissue samples from the resected pancreas of 39 pancreatic cancer patients. We used the online tool GEO2R to screen and pick out the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then we performed functional and pathway enrichment and constructed a DEG-associated protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by searching interacting genes in STRING. By using the visualization software Cytoscape, we sorted the modules in the PPI network and hub genes of DEGs through the MCODE and CytoHubba plugins. In total, 326 DEGs, including 306 upregulated genes and 20 downregulated genes, were targeted in PDAC. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genome (KEGG) pathway and gene ontology (GO), based on the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID), revealed that the DEGs are mainly involved in 'PI3K-Akt signaling pathway,' 'Focal adhesion,' and 'ECM-receptor interaction.' In addition, top 50 core genes were identified from the PPI network by CytoHubba. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) survival analysis showed that high expressions of KRT7, KRT19, SEMA3C, ITGA2, MYOF, and ANXA1 may predict poor survival outcome in PDAC. Finally, Oncomine confirmed that the high expressions of these genes were strongly related to cancer grade. These hub genes and regulators straightened out the molecular pathways and recurrence mechanisms in PDAC and could be used as targets for PDAC's diagnosis, treatment, and prognostic prediction.",2020-06-01,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal, Datasets as Topic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Neoplasm Recurrence, Local, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Pancreas, Pancreatectomy, Pancreatic Neoplasms, Prognosis, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps, Survival Analysis",Discov Med,,Shang
32304781,Genome-wide mining and comparative analysis of fatty acid elongase gene family in Brassica napus and its progenitors.,"Very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) that are structural components of cell membrane lipid, cuticular waxes and seed oil, play crucial roles in plant growth, development and stress response. Fatty acid elongases (FAEs) comprising KCS and ELO, are key enzymes for VLCFA biosynthesis in plants. Although reference genomes of Brassica napus and its parental speices both have been sequenced, whole-genome analysis of FAE gene family in these Brassica speices is not reported. Here, 58, 33 and 30 KCS genes were identified in B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea genomes, respectively, whereas 14, 6 and 8 members were obtained for ELO genes. These KCS genes were unevenly located in 37 chromosomes and 3 scaffolds of 3 Brassica species, while these ELO genes were mapped to 19 chromosomes. The KCS and ELO proteins were divided into 8 and 4 subclasses, respectively. Gene structure and protein motifs remained highly conserved in each KCS or ELO subclass. Most promoters of KCS and ELO genes harbored various plant growth-, phytohormone-, and stress response-related cis-acting elements. 20 SSR loci existed in the KCS and ELO genes/promoters. The whole-genome duplication and segmental duplication mainly contributed to expansion of KCS and ELO genes in these genomes. Transcriptome analysis showed that KCS and ELO genes in 3 Brassica species were expressed in various tissues/organs with different levels, whereas 1 BnELO gene and 6 BnKCS genes might be pathogen-responsive genes. The qRT-PCR assay showed that BnKCS22 and BnELO04 responded to various phytohormone treatments and abiotic stresses.

32391055,Identification of Crucial Genes Associated With Immune Cell Infiltration in Hepatocellular Carcinoma by Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis.,"The dreadful prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is primarily due to the low early diagnosis rate, rapid progression, and high recurrence rate. Valuable prognostic biomarkers are urgently needed for HCC. In this study, microarray data were downloaded from GSE14520, GSE22058, International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified among GSE14520, GSE22058, and ICGC databases. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to establish gene co-expression modules of DEGs, and genes of key modules were examined to identify hub genes using univariate Cox regression in the ICGC cohort. Expression levels and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were determined to estimate the prognostic competence of the hub genes. These hub genes were also validated in the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and TCGA databases. TIMER algorithm and GSCALite database were applied to analyze the association of the hub genes with immunocytotic infiltration and their pathway enrichment. Altogether, 276 DEGs were identified and WGCNA described a unique and significantly DEGs-associated co-expression module containing 148 genes, with 10 hub genes selected by univariate Cox regression in the ICGC cohort (BIRC5, FOXM1, CENPA, KIF4A, DTYMK, PRC1, IGF2BP3, KIF2C, TRIP13, and TPX2). Most of the genes were validated in the GEPIA databases, except IGF2BP3. The results of multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that the abovementioned hub genes are all independent predictors of HCC. The 10 genes were also confirmed to be associated with immune cell infiltration using the TIMER algorithm. Moreover, four-gene signature was developed, including BIRC5, CENPA, FOXM1, DTYMK. These hub genes and the model demonstrated a strong prognostic capability and are likely to be a therapeutic target for HCC. Moreover, the association of these genes with immune cell infiltration improves our understanding of the occurrence and development of HCC.",,,Front Genet,,Wang

ADHD is acknowledged to have a high heritability component (70-80%). Recently, a meta-analysis of GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies) has demonstrated the association of several independent loci. Our main aim here, is to apply PASCAL (pathway scoring algorithm), a new gene-based analysis (GBA) method, to the summary statistics obtained in this meta-analysis. PASCAL will take into account the linkage disequilibrium (LD) across genomic regions in a different way than the most commonly employed GBA methods (MAGMA or VEGAS (Versatile Gene-based Association Study)). In addition to PASCAL analysis a gene network and an enrichment analysis for KEGG and GO terms were carried out.

A perfect reference gene should have a constant expression level under all the experimental conditions. However, the same few housekeeping genes selected from the literature or successfully used in previous unrelated experiments are often routinely used in new conditions without proper validation of their stability across treatments. The advent of RNA-Seq and the availability of public datasets for numerous organisms are opening the way to finding better reference genes for expression studies. Globodera rostochiensis is a plant-parasitic nematode that is particularly yield-limiting for potato. The aim of our study was to identify a reliable set of reference genes to study G. rostochiensis gene expression. Gene expression levels from an RNA-Seq database were used to identify putative reference genes and were validated with qRT-PCR analysis.

31974616,Identification of aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes and gene ontology in prostate cancer.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequent urological malignancy in men worldwide. DNA methylation has an essential role in the etiology and pathogenesis of PCa. The purpose of the present study was to identify the aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes and to determine their potential roles in PCa. The important node genes identified were screened by integrated analysis. Gene expression microarrays and gene methylation microarrays were downloaded and aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes were obtained. Enrichment analysis and protein‑protein interactions (PPI) were obtained, their interactive and visual networks were created, and the node genes in the PPI network were validated. A total of 105 hypomethylation‑high expression genes and 561 hypermethylation‑low expression genes along with their biological processes were identified. The top 10 node genes obtained from the PPI network were identified for each of the two gene groups. The methylation and gene expression status of node genes in TCGA database, GEPIA tool, and the HPA database were generally consistent with those of our results. In conclusion, the present study identified 20 aberrantly methylated‑differentially expressed genes in PCa by combining bioinformatics analyses of gene expression and gene methylation microarrays, and concurrently, the survival of these genes was analyzed. Notably, methylation is a reversible biological process, which makes it of great biological significance for the diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer using bioinformatics technology to determine abnormal methylation gene markers. The present study provided novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of PCa.",,,Mol Med Rep,,Wang

In our study, antimicrobial resistance patterns, antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes of 52 guppy-borne Aeromonas sp. were examined. The isolates were identified as A. veronii (n = 34), A. dhakensis (n = 10), A. hydrophila (n = 3), A. caviae (n = 3) and A. enteropelogenes (n = 2) by gyrB gene sequencing. Every isolate was resistant to at least four antimicrobials in disc diffusion test. The resistance to amoxicillin, nalidixic acid and oxytetracycline was 100% among the tested isolates. 92·30, 76·92, 71·15, 51·92, 51·92 and 50·00% of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin, rifampicin, imipenem, cephalothin, tetracycline and trimethoprim respectively. The multiple antibiotic resistance index values ranged from 0·28 to 0·67. PCR amplification of antimicrobial resistance genes implied the occurrence of tetracycline resistance (tetA (65·39%), tetE (25·00%) and tetB (15·38%)), plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (qnrS (26·92%) and qnrB (17·31%)) and aminoglycoside resistance (aphaAI-IAB (7·69%) and aac (6')-Ib (3·84%)) genes in the isolates. The IntI gene was positive for 36·54% of the isolates and four class 1 integron gene cassette profiles (aadA2, qacE2-orfD, aadA2-catB2 and dfrA12-aadA2) were identified. These data suggest that ornamental guppy can be a reservoir of multidrug-resistant Aeromonas sp. which comprise different antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integrons. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Antimicrobial resistance genes and integron gene cassettes of ornamental fish-borne aeromonads are poorly studied. The antimicrobial resistance patterns, antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes of Aeromonas sp. isolated from ornamental guppy were characterized for the first time in Korea. The incidence of different antimicrobial resistance genes and class 1 integron gene cassettes were observed in multidrug-resistant Aeromonas isolates. This result suggests that better management practices are necessary to prevent and address the serious consequences of indiscriminate and inappropriate antimicrobial use, and the distribution of multidrug-resistant bacteria.",2019-07-30,"Aeromonas, Animals, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Aquaculture, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Integrons, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Poecilia, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Republic of Korea",Lett Appl Microbiol,10.1111/lam.13162,Hossain

31173206,Identification of critical genes associated with human osteosarcoma metastasis based on integrated gene expression profiling.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone cancer, which often affects teenagers and young adults. The present study aimed to screen for critical genes and microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) involved in osteosarcoma. A total of four microarray datasets (accession numbers GSE32981, GSE21257, GSE14827 and GSE14359) were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following data preprocessing, module analysis was performed to identify the stable modules using the weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA) package. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between metastatic samples and non‑metastatic samples were screened, followed by gene co‑expression network construction, and Gene Ontology function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses. Subsequently, prognosis‑associated genes were screened and a miRNA‑target gene regulatory network was constructed. Finally, the data for critical genes were validated. WGCNA analysis identified six modules; blue and yellow modules were significantly positively associated with osteosarcoma metastasis. A total of 1,613 DEGs were screened between primary tissue samples and metastatic samples. Following comparison of the genes in the two (blue and yellow) modules, a total of 166 DEGs were identified (metastatic samples vs. non‑metastatic samples). Functional enrichment analysis demonstrated that these DEGs were mainly involved in 'defense response', 'p53 signaling pathway' and 'lysosome'. By utilizing the clinical information in GSE21257, 10 critical genes associated with osteosarcoma prognosis were obtained, including CTP synthase 2 (CTPS2), tumor protein p53 inducible protein 3 (TP53I3) and solute carrier family 1 member 1 (SLC1A1). In addition, hsa‑miR‑422a and hsa‑miR‑194 were highlighted in the miRNA‑target gene network. Finally, matrix metallopeptidase 3 (MMP3) and vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) were predicted as critical genes in osteosarcoma metastasis.

To enhance our understanding of the essentiality of genes, in OGEE we collected experimentally tested essential and non-essential genes, as well as associated gene properties known to contribute to gene essentiality. We focus on large-scale experiments, and complement our data with text-mining results. We organized tested genes into data sets according to their sources, and tagged those with variable essentiality statuses across data sets as conditionally essential genes, intending to highlight the complex interplay between gene functions and environments/experimental perturbations. Developments since the last public release include increased numbers of species and gene essentiality data sets, inclusion of non-coding essential sequences and genes with intermediate essentiality statuses. In addition, we included 16 essentiality data sets from cancer cell lines, corresponding to 9 human cancers; with OGEE, users can easily explore the shared and differentially essential genes within and between cancer types. These genes, especially those derived from cell lines that are similar to tumor samples, could reveal the oncogenic drivers, paralogous gene expression pattern and chromosomal structure of the corresponding cancer types, and can be further screened to identify targets for cancer therapy and/or new drug development.

32006176,Phylogenetic analysis of achaete-scute complex genes in metazoans.,"Achaete-scute complex (ASC) genes play essential roles in regulating neurogenesis of metazoans. Various metazoan species have greatly different numbers of genes in ASCa, ASCb and ASCc families. To explore evolutionary mechanisms of metazoan ASC genes, Blast (basic local alignment search tool) searches and phylogenetic analyses were conducted to identify ASC genes in metazoan species and to infer phylogenetic relationship between various ASC genes. As a result, 2784 ASC genes were identified in 804 metazoan species. The phylogenetic tree constructed using 1237 unique bHLH motifs shows that metazoan ASCa, ASCb and ASCc families contain six (a1-a6), five (b1-b5) and three (c1-c3) bHLH genes, respectively. Further phylogenetic analyses suggest that ASC genes in metazoans are derived from a primitive c gene, those in insects are derived from c2 gene, and those in chordates are derived from a2 and a3 genes. Data of gene linkage demonstrate that insect a6 is derived from a4 but not from a5, and chordate a2 is ancestral to b5 only, whilst a3 is ancestral to both b3 and b5. It is concluded that current ASC gene families in metazoans were established through a series of sub- and/or neo-functionalization to duplicated ancestral ASC gene(s). These results provide good references for exploring evolutionary mechanisms of other bHLH genes in metazoans. Besides, gene subtyping is considered as an efficient method for evolutionary studies on closely related homologous genes.",2020-05-21,"Achaete-Scute Complex Genome Region, Animals, Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Genomics, Phylogeny",Mol Genet Genomics,,Wang
32020426,Identification and evaluation of suitable reference genes for gene expression analysis in rubber tree leaf.,"Gene expression profiles are increasingly applied to investigate molecular mechanism for which, normalization with suitable reference genes is critical. Previously we have reported several suitable reference genes for laticifer samples from rubber tree, however, little is known in leaf. The main objective of this current study was to identify some stable expression reference genes at various developmental stages of leaf, as well as during abiotic (high and low temperature extremes) and biotic stresses (pathogen stress). Gene expression profilings identified the ubiquitin-proteasome system as excellent potential as reference genes for rubber tree leaf. Among a total of 30 tested genes investigated, 24 new candidate (including 11 genes involved in the ubiquitin-proteasome system), 4 previously identified and 2 specific genes, were further evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR. Our results indicated that the new candidate genes had better expression stability comparing with others. For instance, an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (RG0099) and three ubiquitin-protein ligases (RG0928, RG2190 and RG0118) expressed stably in all samples, and were confirmed to be suitable reference genes for rubber tree leaf under four different conditions. Finally, we suggest that using more than one reference gene may be appropriate in gene expression studies when employing different software to normalize gene expression data.

25743543,Neighboring Genes Show Correlated Evolution in Gene Expression.,"When considering the evolution of a gene's expression profile, we commonly assume that this is unaffected by its genomic neighborhood. This is, however, in contrast to what we know about the lack of autonomy between neighboring genes in gene expression profiles in extant taxa. Indeed, in all eukaryotic genomes genes of similar expression-profile tend to cluster, reflecting chromatin level dynamics. Does it follow that if a gene increases expression in a particular lineage then the genomic neighbors will also increase in their expression or is gene expression evolution autonomous? To address this here we consider evolution of human gene expression since the human-chimp common ancestor, allowing for both variation in estimation of current expression level and error in Bayesian estimation of the ancestral state. We find that in all tissues and both sexes, the change in gene expression of a focal gene on average predicts the change in gene expression of neighbors. The effect is highly pronounced in the immediate vicinity (<100 kb) but extends much further. Sex-specific expression change is also genomically clustered. As genes increasing their expression in humans tend to avoid nuclear lamina domains and be enriched for the gene activator 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, we conclude that, most probably owing to chromatin level control of gene expression, a change in gene expression of one gene likely affects the expression evolution of neighbors, what we term expression piggybacking, an analog of hitchhiking.

29309420,Selection of appropriate reference genes for the detection of rhythmic gene expression via quantitative real-time PCR in Tibetan hulless barley.,"Hulless barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. nudum. hook. f.) has been cultivated as a major crop in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau of China for thousands of years. Compared to other cereal crops, the Tibetan hulless barley has developed stronger endogenous resistances to survive in the severe environment of its habitat. To understand the unique resistant mechanisms of this plant, detailed genetic studies need to be performed. The quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is the most commonly used method in detecting gene expression. However, the selection of stable reference genes under limited experimental conditions was considered to be an essential step for obtaining accurate results in qRT-PCR. In this study, 10 candidate reference genes-ACT (Actin), E2 (Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 2), TUBα (Alpha-tubulin), TUBβ6 (Beta-tubulin 6), GAPDH (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), EF-1α (Elongation factor 1-alpha), SAMDC (S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase), PKABA1 (Gene for protein kinase HvPKABA1), PGK (Phosphoglycerate kinase), and HSP90 (Heat shock protein 90)-were selected from the NCBI gene database of barley. Following qRT-PCR amplifications of all candidate reference genes in Tibetan hulless barley seedlings under various stressed conditions, the stabilities of these candidates were analyzed by three individual software packages including geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper. The results demonstrated that TUBβ6, E2, TUBα, and HSP90 were generally the most suitable sets under all tested conditions; similarly, TUBα and HSP90 showed peak stability under salt stress, TUBα and EF-1α were the most suitable reference genes under cold stress, and ACT and E2 were the most stable under drought stress. Finally, a known circadian gene CCA1 was used to verify the service ability of chosen reference genes. The results confirmed that all recommended reference genes by the three software were suitable for gene expression analysis under tested stress conditions by the qRT-PCR method.",2018-02-21,"Cold Temperature, Droughts, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Hordeum, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Salinity, Stress, Physiological, Tibet",PLoS One,,Cai

30655072,Identifying condition specific key genes from basal-like breast cancer gene expression data.,"Mining patterns of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions help to narrow down the search space for the analysis of gene expression data. Identifying conditions specific key genes from the large-scale gene expression data is a challenging task. The conditions specific key gene signifies functional behavior of a group of co-expressed genes across the subset of conditions and can be act as biomarkers of the diseases. In this paper, we have propose a novel approach for identification of conditions specific key genes from Basal-Like Breast Cancer (BLBC) disease using biclustering algorithm and Gene Co-expression Network (GCN). The proposed approach is a two-stage approach. In the first stage, significant biclusters have been extracted with the help of 'runibic' biclustering algorithm. The second stage identifies conditions specific key genes from the extracted significant biclusters with the help of GCN. By using difference matrix and gene correlation matrix, we have constructed biologically meaningful and statistically strong GCN. Also, presented the proposed approach with the help of a process diagram and demonstrated the procedure with an example of bicluster number 93 (Bic93). From the experimental results, we observed that 95% and 85% of the extracted biclusters are found to be biologically significant at the p-values less than 0.05 and 0.01 respectively. We have compared proposed approach with the Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) based approach. From the comparison, our approach has performed effectively and extracted biologically significant biclusters. Also, identified conditions specific key genes which cannot be extracted using the WGCNA based approach. Some of the important identified known key genes are PIK3CA, SHC3, ERBB2, SHC4, PTOV1, STAG1, ZNF215 etc. These key genes can be used as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for the BLBC disease after the rigorous analysis. The identified conditions specific key genes can be helpful to reduce the analysis time and increase the accuracy of further research such as biomarker identification, drug target discovery etc.",2019-04-03,"Algorithms, Biomarkers, Tumor, Breast Neoplasms, Cluster Analysis, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans",Comput Biol Chem,10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2018.12.022,Maind
30680001,Hub genes and gene functions associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis predicted by an integrated method.,"Postmenopausal osteoporosis (PO) imposes great burden on individuals and society. This study predicted hub genes and gene functions for PO by an integration of the convergent evidence (CE) method, rank product (RP) algorithm and the combing of P-values. Using the gene expression data, genes were ranked by the CE method, RP algorithm and combing P-values, respectively. Subsequently, the top 100 genes were selected from each of the three gene lists, and then the common genes for two or three methods were denoted as informative genes of PO. A mutual information network (MIN) was constructed for the informative genes utilizing the context likelihood of relatedness algorithm. Topological centrality (degree) analysis was conducted on the MIN to investigate hub genes. Then we performed Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis dependent upon the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool (BiNGO) plugin of Cytoscape to investigate hub gene functions for PO patients. Consequently, a total of 82 informative genes were obtained by integrating the results of the three methods. There were 82 nodes and 1,741 edges in the MIN, of which 8 hub genes were identified, such as PFN1, EEF2 and S100A9. The result of GO enrichment analysis showed that 49 GO terms with P<0.001 were detected, especially the top 5 gene sets were defined as hub gene functions of PO, for instance, translational elongation, translation and cellular macromolecule biosynthetic process. In conclusion, we have predicted 8 hub genes and 5 hub gene functions associated with PO patients. The findings might help understand the molecular mechanism underlying PO.",,,Exp Ther Med,,Cao
31581635,Integrating GWAS and Gene Expression Analysis Identifies Candidate Genes for Root Morphology Traits in Maize at the Seedling Stage.,"Root system plays an essential role in water and nutrient acquisition in plants. Understanding the genetic basis of root development will be beneficial for breeding new cultivars with efficient root system to enhance resource use efficiency in maize. Here, the natural variation of 13 root and 3 shoot traits was evaluated in 297 maize inbred lines and genome-wide association mapping was conducted to identify SNPs associated with target traits. All measured traits exhibited 2.02- to 21.36-fold variations. A total of 34 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected for 13 traits, and each individual QTL explained 5.7% to 15.9% of the phenotypic variance. Three pleiotropic QTLs involving five root traits were identified; SNP_2_104416607 was associated with lateral root length (LRL), root surface area (RA), root length between 0 and 0.5mm in diameter (RL005), and total root length (TRL); SNP_2_184016997 was associated with RV and RA, and SNP_4_168917747 was associated with LRL, RA and TRL. The expression levels of candidate genes in root QTLs were evaluated by RNA-seq among three long-root lines and three short-root lines. A total of five genes that showed differential expression between the long- and short-root lines were identified as promising candidate genes for the target traits. These QTLs and the potential candidate genes are important source data to understand root development and genetic improvement of root traits in maize.",2020-03-20,"Breeding, Chromosome Mapping, Gene Expression Profiling, Genome-Wide Association Study, Phenotype, Plant Roots, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Seedlings, Zea mays",Genes (Basel),,Wang
29183612,"Suitable reference genes for accurate gene expression analysis in Papaver rhoeas under 2,4-D herbicide stress.","Resistance to 2,4-D (2,4-diclorophenoxyacetic acid) herbicide is increasing in various dicotyledonous weed species, including Papaver rhoeas, a weed infesting Southern European wheat crops. Non-target-site resistance to this herbicide is governed by a range of genes involved in herbicide stress response. To enable reliable measurement of gene expression levels in herbicide-resistant and susceptible plants it is necessary to normalize qPCR data using internal control genes with stable expression. In an attempt to find the best reference genes, the stability of seven candidate reference genes was assessed in plants resistant and susceptible to 2,4-D, subjected or not to herbicide stress. Using three statistical algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder), the overall results revealed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin and ubiquitin were the most stable reference genes. The normalization expression levels of GH3 (indole-3-acetic acid amido synthetase) and GST3 (glutathione S-transferase) which are two genes up-regulated following 2,4-D treatment, were determined to verify the stability of these selected reference genes. A sudden increase in GH3 and GST3 expression was already detected 5h after herbicide application, confirming their involvement in plant response to 2,4-D. The validation results confirmed the applicability and accuracy of these reference genes. This study identified and validated reference genes in the non-model weed species P. rhoeas and these will facilitate gene expression analysis studies aimed at identifying functional genes associated with non-target-site resistance.",2018-07-18,"2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic Acid, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Herbicides, Papaver, Plant Proteins, Plant Weeds, Stress, Physiological",Pestic Biochem Physiol,10.1016/j.pestbp.2017.09.008,Scarabel

29693161,Study on the association between drug‑resistance and gene mutations of the active efflux pump acrAB‑tolC gene and its regulatory genes.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between the multi‑drug resistance of Shigella flexneri and the drug‑resistant gene cassette carried by integrons; in the meanwhile, to detect the associations between drug‑resistance and gene mutations of the active efflux pump acrAB‑tolC gene and its regulatory genes, including marOR, acrR and soxS. A total of 158 isolates were isolated from the stool samples of 1,026 children with diarrhoea aged 14 years old between May 2012 and October 2015 in Henan. The K‑B method was applied for the determination of drug resistance of Shigella flexneri, and polymerase chain reaction amplification was used for class 1, 2 and 3 integrase genes. Enzyme digestion and sequence analysis were performed for the variable regions of positive strains. Based on the drug sensitivity assessment, multi‑drug resistant strains that were resistant to five or more antibiotics, and sensitive strains were selected for amplification. Their active efflux pump genes, acrA and acrB, and regulatory genes, marOR, acrR and soxS, were selected for sequencing. The results revealed that 91.1% of the 158 strains were multi‑resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline and streptomycin, and 69.6% of the strains were multi‑resistant to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. The resistance to ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was <32.9%. All strains (100%) were sensitive to cefoxitin, cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem. The rate of the class 1 integron positivity was 91.9% (144/158). Among these class 1 integron‑positive strains, 18 strains exhibited the resistance gene cassette dfrV in the variable region of the strain, four strains exhibited dfrA17‑aadA5 in the variable region and 140 strains exhibited blaOXA‑30‑aadA1 in the variable region. Four strains showed no resistance gene in the variable regions. The rate of class 2 integron positivity was 86.1% (136/158), and all positive strains harboured the dfrA1‑sat1‑aadA resistance gene cassette in the variable region. The class 3 integrase gene was not detected in these strains. The gene sequencing showed the deletion of base CATT in the 36, 37, 38, 39 site in the marOR gene, which is a regulatory gene of the active efflux pump, AcrAB‑TolC. Taken together, the multi‑drug resistance of Shigella flexneri was closely associated with gene mutations of class 1 and 2 integrons and the marOR gene.",2018-09-26,"Adolescent, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Child, Child, Preschool, Drug Resistance, Bacterial, Dysentery, Bacillary, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genes, Bacterial, Humans, Infant, Male, Microbial Sensitivity Tests, Mutation, Phenotype, Shigella flexneri",Mol Med Rep,,Ma
28802020,"Investigation of the diversity of effector genes in the banana pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense, reveals evidence of horizontal gene transfer.","It is hypothesized that the virulence of phytopathogenic fungi is mediated through the secretion of small effector proteins that interfere with the defence responses of the host plant. In Fusarium oxysporum, one family of effectors, the Secreted In Xylem (SIX) genes, has been identified. We sought to characterize the diversity and evolution of the SIX genes in the banana-infecting lineages of F. oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc). Whole-genome sequencing data were generated for the 23 genetic lineages of Foc, which were subsequently queried for the 14 known SIX genes (SIX1-SIX14). The sequences of the identified SIX genes were confirmed in a larger collection of Foc isolates. Genealogies were generated for each of the SIX genes identified in Foc to further investigate the evolution of the SIX genes in Foc. Within Foc, variation of the SIX gene profile, including the presence of specific SIX homologues, correlated with the pathogenic race structure of Foc. Furthermore, the topologies of the SIX gene trees were discordant with the topology of an infraspecies phylogeny inferred from EF-1α/RPB1/RPB2 (translation elongation factor-1α/RNA polymerase II subunit I/RNA polymerase II subunit II). A series of topological constraint models provided strong evidence for the horizontal transmission of SIX genes in Foc. The horizontal inheritance of pathogenicity genes in Foc counters previous assumptions that convergent evolution has driven the polyphyletic phylogeny of Foc. This work has significant implications for the management of Foc, including the improvement of diagnostics and breeding programmes.",2019-02-27,"Base Sequence, Evolution, Molecular, Fusarium, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genes, Essential, Genes, Fungal, Genetic Variation, Inheritance Patterns, Likelihood Functions, Musa, Phylogeny, Species Specificity",Mol Plant Pathol,,Czislowski

28168930,Avirulence (AVR) Gene-Based Diagnosis Complements Existing Pathogen Surveillance Tools for Effective Deployment of Resistance (R) Genes Against Rice Blast Disease.,"Avirulence (AVR) genes in Magnaporthe oryzae, the fungal pathogen that causes the devastating rice blast disease, have been documented to be major targets subject to mutations to avoid recognition by resistance (R) genes. In this study, an AVR-gene-based diagnosis tool for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population was developed and validated. A set of 77 single-spore field isolates was subjected to pathotype analysis using differential lines, each containing a single R gene, and classified into 20 virulent pathotypes, except for 4 isolates that lost pathogenicity. In all, 10 differential lines showed low frequency (<24%) of resistance whereas 8 lines showed a high frequency (>95%), inferring the effectiveness of R genes present in the respective differential lines. In addition, the haplotypes of seven AVR genes were determined by polymerase chain reaction amplification and sequencing, if applicable. The calculated frequency of different AVR genes displayed significant variations in the population. AVRPiz-t and AVR-Pii were detected in 100 and 84.9% of the isolates, respectively. Five AVR genes such as AVR-Pik-D (20.5%) and AVR-Pik-E (1.4%), AVRPiz-t (2.7%), AVR-Pita (0%), AVR-Pia (0%), and AVR1-CO39 (0%) displayed low or even zero frequency. The frequency of AVR genes correlated almost perfectly with the resistance frequency of the cognate R genes in differential lines, except for International Rice Research Institute-bred blast-resistant lines IRBLzt-T, IRBLta-K1, and IRBLkp-K60. Both genetic analysis and molecular marker validation revealed an additional R gene, most likely Pi19 or its allele, in these three differential lines. This can explain the spuriously higher resistance frequency of each target R gene based on conventional pathotyping. This study demonstrates that AVR-gene-based diagnosis provides a precise, R-gene-specific, and differential line-free assessment method that can be used for determining the virulence spectrum of a rice blast pathogen population and for predicting the effectiveness of target R genes in rice varieties.",2017-07-20,"Alleles, Cluster Analysis, Disease Resistance, Fungal Proteins, Genetic Variation, Haplotypes, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Magnaporthe, Mutation, Oryza, Phenotype, Philippines, Plant Diseases, Virulence",Phytopathology,10.1094/PHYTO-12-16-0451-R,Selisana

No validated reference gene has been indentified from P. brassicacearum to use in the normalization of real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR data. Therefore, in this study, nine candidate reference genes (recA, gyrA, rpoD, proC, gmk, rho, 16S, ftsz, and secA) were assessed at different growth phases and under various growth conditions. The expression stability of these candidate genes was evaluated using BestKeeper, NormFinder and GeNorm. In general, the results showed rho, rpoD and gyrA were the most suitable reference genes for P. brassicacearum GS20. The relative expression of iron-regulated gene (fhu) was normalized to verify the reliability of the proposed reference genes under iron-replete and iron-limited conditions.

31904409,Validation of reference genes for gene expression analysis following experimental traumatic brain injury in a pediatric mouse model.,"Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the gold standard method in targeted analysis of messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in a tissue. To minimize methodological errors, a reference gene (or a combination of reference genes) is routinely used for normalization to account for technical variables such as RNA quality and sample size. While presumed to have stable expression, reference genes in the brain can change during normal development, as well as in response to injury, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI). This study is the first to evaluate the stability of reference genes in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) model in the pediatric mouse brain, using two methods of qPCR normalization for optimal reference gene selection. Three week old mice were subjected to unilateral CCI at two severity of injuries (mild or severe), compared to sham controls. At 1 and 8 weeks post-injury, the ipsilateral hemisphere was analyzed to determine reference gene stability. Five commonly-used reference genes were compared: tyrosine 3 monooxygenase/tryptophan 5 monooxygenase activation protein zeta (Ywhaz), cyclophilin A (Ppia), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase (Hprt), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gapdh) and β-actin (Actb). Ppia and Hprt were chosen as the most stable combination of genes using GeNORM software analysis. These results highlight the instability of several commonly used reference genes after TBI, and provide a selection of validated genes for future gene expression analyses in the injured pediatric mouse brain.",,,Brain Res Bull,10.1016/j.brainresbull.2019.12.015,Zamani

30617544,Genome-wide investigation of the MADS gene family and dehulling genes in tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum).,"Genome-wide identification, expression analysis and potential functional characterization of previously uncharacterized MADS family of tartary buckwheat, emphasized the importance of this gene family in plant growth and development. The MADS transcription factor is a key regulatory factor in the development of most plants. The MADS gene in plants controls all aspects of tissue and organ growth and reproduction and can be used to regulate plant seed cracking. However, there has been little research on the MADS genes of tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), which is an important edible and medicinal crop. The recently published whole genome sequence of tartary buckwheat allows us to study the tissue and expression profiles of the MADS gene in tartary buckwheat at a genome-wide level. In this study, 65 MADS genes of tartary buckwheat were identified and renamed according to the chromosomal distribution of the FtMADS genes. Here, we provide a complete overview of the gene structure, gene expression, genomic mapping, protein motif organization, and phylogenetic relationships of each member of the gene family. According to the phylogenetic relationship of MADS genes, the transcription factor family was divided into two subfamilies, the M subfamily (28 genes) and the MIKC subfamily (37 genes). The results showed that the FtMADS genes belonged to related sister pairs and the chromosomal map showed that the replication of FtMADSs was related to the replication of chromosome blocks. In different tissues and at different fruit development stages, the FtMADS genes obtained by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed obvious expression patterns. A comprehensive analysis of the MADS genes in tartary buckwheat was conducted. Through systematic analysis, the potential genes that may regulate the growth and development of tartary buckwheat and the genes that may regulate the easy dehulling of tartary buckwheat fruit were screened, which laid a solid foundation for improving the quality of tartary buckwheat.",2019-05-13,"Fagopyrum, Fruit, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins",Planta,,Liu

Selenium (Se) deficiency is closely related to KD, while magnesium (Mg) plays many critical roles in the cardiovascular function. The molecular mechanism of KD pathogenesis is still unclear. Until now, we have not found any studies investigating the association between Se- or Mg-related genes and KD. In this study, oligonucleotide microarray analysis was used to identify the differentially expressed genes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells between KD patients and normal controls. Next, human metabolome database (HMDB) was used to screen Se- and Mg-related genes. Function classification, gene pathway, and interaction network of Se- and Mg-related genes in KD peripheral blood mononuclear cells were defined by FunRich (functional enrichment analysis tool). Among 83 differentially expressed genes, five Se-related (DIO2, GPX1, GPX2, GPX4, and GPX7) and five Mg-related (ACSL6, EYA4, IDH2, PPM1A, and STK11) genes were recognized from HMDB. Two significant biological processes (energy pathways and metabolism), one molecular function (peroxidase activity), one biological pathway (glutathione redox reactions I), and one gene interaction network were constituted from Se-related and Mg-related genes. Se-related gene DIO2 and Mg-related genes STK11 and IDH2 may have key roles in the myocardial dysfunction of KD. However, we still have not obtained any interaction between Se-related gene and Mg-related gene.

In this study, antibiogram, antimicrobial resistance genes and integrons of 43 zebrafish-borne Aeromonas spp. were studied. The isolates were identified as six Aeromonas species (A. veronii biovar veronii (n = 26), A. veronii biovar sobria (n = 3), A. hydrophila (n = 8), A. caviae (n = 3), A. enteropelogenes (n = 2) and A. dhakensis (n = 1)). Antibiogram of the isolates indicated that most of them were resistant to amoxicillin (100·00%), nalidixic acid (100·00%), oxytetracycline (100·00%), ampicillin (93·02%), tetracycline (74·42%), rifampicin (67·44%) and imipenem (65·15%). Multiple antimicrobial resistance (MAR) index values ranged from 0·19-0·44 to 90·70% isolates showed multidrug resistance. PCR of antimicrobial resistance genes revealed that the tetracycline resistance gene (tetA) was the most predominant (67·44%) among the isolates. The qnrS (53·49%), tetB (30·23%), tetE (30·23%), qnrB (23·26%) and aac(6')-Ib-cr (4·65%) genes were also detected. Class 1 integrase (IntI1) gene was found in 46·51% of the isolates. Two types of class 1 integron gene cassette profiles (qacG-aadA6-qacG and drfA1) were identified.

28171660,The human RHOX gene cluster: target genes and functional analysis of gene variants in infertile men.,"The X-linked reproductive homeobox (RHOX) gene cluster encodes transcription factors preferentially expressed in reproductive tissues. This gene cluster has important roles in male fertility based on phenotypic defects of Rhox-mutant mice and the finding that aberrant RHOX promoter methylation is strongly associated with abnormal human sperm parameters. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of RHOX function in humans. Using gene expression profiling, we identified genes regulated by members of the human RHOX gene cluster. Some genes were uniquely regulated by RHOXF1 or RHOXF2/2B, while others were regulated by both of these transcription factors. Several of these regulated genes encode proteins involved in processes relevant to spermatogenesis; e.g. stress protection and cell survival. One of the target genes of RHOXF2/2B is RHOXF1, suggesting cross-regulation to enhance transcriptional responses. The potential role of RHOX in human infertility was addressed by sequencing all RHOX exons in a group of 250 patients with severe oligozoospermia. This revealed two mutations in RHOXF1 (c.515G > A and c.522C > T) and four in RHOXF2/2B (-73C > G, c.202G > A, c.411C > T and c.679G > A), of which only one (c.202G > A) was found in a control group of men with normal sperm concentration. Functional analysis demonstrated that c.202G > A and c.679G > A significantly impaired the ability of RHOXF2/2B to regulate downstream genes.

26510741,"Altered Blood Gene Expression of Tumor-Related Genes (PRKCB, BECN1, and CDKN2A) in Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common of the neurodegenerative diseases. Recent diagnostic criteria have defined a preclinical disease phase during which neuropathological substrates are thought to be present in the brain. There is an urgent need to find measurable alterations in this phase as well as a good peripheral biomarker in the blood. We selected a cohort of 100 subjects (controls = 47; preclinical AD = 11; patients with AD = 42) and analyzed whole blood expression of 20 genes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The selected genes belonged to calcium signaling, senescence and autophagy, and mitochondria/oxidative stress pathways. Additionally, two genes associated with an increased risk of developing AD (clusterin (CLU) and bridging integrator 1 (BIN1)) were also analyzed. We detected significantly different gene expressions of BECN1 and PRKCB between the control and the AD groups and of CDKN2A between the control and the preclinical AD groups. Notably, these three genes are also considered tumor suppressor (CDKN2A and BECN1) or tumor promoter (PRKCB) genes. Gene-gene expression Pearson correlations were computed separately for controls and patients with AD. The significant correlations (p < 0.001) were represented in a network analysis with Cytoscape tool, which suggested an uncoupling of mitochondria-related genes in AD group.

27841319,"LbCML38 and LbRH52, two reference genes derived from RNA-Seq data suitable for assessing gene expression in Lycium barbarum L.","For quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, the key prerequisite that determines result accuracy is the selection of appropriate reference gene(s). Goji (Lycium barbarum L.) is a multi-branched shrub belonging to the Solanaceae family. To date, no systematic screening or evaluation of reference gene(s) in Goji has been performed. In this work, we identified 18 candidate reference genes from the transcriptomic sequencing data of 14 samples of Goji at different developmental stages and under drought stress condition. The expression stability of these candidate genes was rigorously analyzed using qRT-PCR and four different statistical algorithms: geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder. Two novel reference genes LbCML38 and LbRH52 showed the most stable expression, whereas the traditionally used reference genes such as LbGAPDH, LbHSP90 and LbTUB showed unstable expression in the tested samples. Expression of a target gene LbMYB1 was also tested and compared using optimal reference genes LbCML38 and LbRH52, mediocre reference gene LbActin7, and poor reference gene LbHSP90 as normalization standards, respectively. As expected, calculation of the target gene expression by normalization against LbCML38, LbActin7 or LbHSP90 showed significant differences. Our findings suggest that LbCML38 and LbRH52 can be used as reference genes for gene expression analysis in Goji.",2018-05-30,"Algorithms, Fruit, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Lycium, Plant Proteins, RNA, Plant, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Sequence Analysis, RNA",Sci Rep,,Gong

32187192,Identifying and validating housekeeping hybrid Prunus spp. genes for root gene-expression studies.,"Prunus rootstock belonging to subgenera Amygdalus (peach), Prunus (plum) and Cerasus (cherry) are either from the same species as the scion or another one. The number of inter-species (including inter-subgenera) hybrids has increased as a result of broadening the genetic basis for stress (biotic and abiotic) resistance/tolerance. Identifying genes associated with important traits and responses requires expression analysis. Relative quantification is the simplest and most popular alternative, which requires reference genes (housekeeping) to normalize RT-qPCR data. However, there is a scarcity of validated housekeeping genes for hybrid Prunus rootstock species. This research aims to increase the number of housekeeping genes suitable for Prunus rootstock expression analysis. Twenty-one candidate housekeeping genes were pre-selected from previous RNAseq data that compared the response of root transcriptomes of two rootstocks subgenera to hypoxia treatment, 'Mariana 2624' (P. cerasifera Ehrh.× P. munsoniana W. Wight & Hedrick), and 'Mazzard F12/1' (P. avium L.). Representing groups of low, intermediate or high levels of expression, the genes were assayed by RT-qPCR at 72 hours of hypoxia treatment and analyzed with NormFinder software. A sub-set of seven housekeeping genes that presented the highest level of stability were selected, two with low levels of expression (Unknown 3, Unknown 7) and five with medium levels (GTB 1, TUA 3, ATPase P, PRT 6, RP II). The stability of these genes was evaluated under different stress conditions, cold and heat with the hybrid 'Mariana 2624' and N nutrition with the hybrids 'Colt' (P. avium × P. pseudocerasus Lindl.) and 'Garnem' [P. dulcis Mill.× (P. persica L.× P. davidiana Carr.)]. The algorithms of geNorm and BestKeeper software also were used to analyze the performance of these genes as housekeepers. Stability rankings varied according to treatments, genotypes and the software for evaluation, but the gene GBT 1 often had the highest ranking. However, most of the genes are suitable depending on the stressor and/or genotype to be evaluated. No optimal number of reference genes could be determined with geNorm software when all conditions and genotypes were considered. These results strongly suggest that relative RT-qPCR should be analyzed separately with their respective best housekeeper according to the treatment and/or genotypes in Prunus spp. rootstocks.",2020-06-22,"Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Essential, Plant Roots, Prunus",PLoS One,,Bastias
25654098,Identification of reference genes in human myelomonocytic cells for gene expression studies in altered gravity.,"Gene expression studies are indispensable for investigation and elucidation of molecular mechanisms. For the process of normalization, reference genes (""housekeeping genes"") are essential to verify gene expression analysis. Thus, it is assumed that these reference genes demonstrate similar expression levels over all experimental conditions. However, common recommendations about reference genes were established during 1 g conditions and therefore their applicability in studies with altered gravity has not been demonstrated yet. The microarray technology is frequently used to generate expression profiles under defined conditions and to determine the relative difference in expression levels between two or more different states. In our study, we searched for potential reference genes with stable expression during different gravitational conditions (microgravity, normogravity, and hypergravity) which are additionally not altered in different hardware systems. We were able to identify eight genes (ALB, B4GALT6, GAPDH, HMBS, YWHAZ, ABCA5, ABCA9, and ABCC1) which demonstrated no altered gene expression levels in all tested conditions and therefore represent good candidates for the standardization of gene expression studies in altered gravity.

31562292,Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Identifies Hub Genes Associated with Occurrence and Prognosis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to identify biomarkers closely related to the pathogenesis and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) by using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) based on integrative transcriptome datasets. MATERIAL AND METHODS Gene expression profiles of OSCC were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained and we then performed with Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis as well as protein-protein interactions (PPI) network analysis. WGCNA was used to construct the co-expression network. Multipart results were intersected to acquire the candidate genes, and survival analysis was used to identify the hub genes. RESULTS A total of 568 DEGs, including 272 upregulated genes and 296 downregulated genes, were identified. GO and pathway analyses revealed that these DEGs were mainly enriched in extracellular matrix (ECM), ECM organization, structural constituent of muscle, and ECM-receptor interaction. The PPI network of DEGs was established, comprising 428 nodes and 1944 edges. In the co-expression network, pink module was the key module, in which 34 genes with high connectivity were identified. After the intersection of multipart results, 24 common genes were chosen as the candidate genes, among which 7 hub genes (PLAU, SERPINE1, LAMC2, ITGA5, TGFBI, FSCN1, and HLF) were identified using survival analysis. CONCLUSIONS Seven potential biomarkers were identified as being closely related with the initiation and prognosis of OSCC and might serve as potential targets for early diagnosis and personalized therapy of OSCC.",2020-03-09,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Computational Biology, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Mouth Neoplasms, Prognosis, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps, Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Head and Neck, Transcriptome",Med Sci Monit,,Ge

30823586,Identification of Potential Genes Responsible for Thermotolerance in Wheat under High Temperature Stress.,"Wheat, a major worldwide staple food crop, is relatively sensitive to a changing environment, including high temperature. The comprehensive mechanism of heat stress response at the molecular level and exploitation of candidate tolerant genes are far from enough. Using transcriptome data, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of wheat under heat stress. A total of 1705 and 17 commonly differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in wheat grain and flag leaf, respectively, through transcriptome analysis. Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment were also applied to illustrate the functions and metabolic pathways of DEGs involved in thermotolerance of wheat grain and flag leaf. Furthermore, our data suggest that there may be a more complex molecular mechanism or tighter regulatory network in flag leaf than in grain under heat stress over time, as less commonly DEGs, more discrete expression profiles of genes (principle component analysis) and less similar pathway response were observed in flag leaf. In addition, we found that transcriptional regulation of zeatin, brassinosteroid and flavonoid biosynthesis pathways may play an important role in wheat's heat tolerance. The expression changes of some genes were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and three potential genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis process were identified.",2019-12-23,"Brassinosteroids, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Plant, Thermotolerance, Transcriptome, Triticum, Zeatin",Genes (Basel),,Su
22561113,Prediction of operon-like gene clusters in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome based on co-expression analysis of neighboring genes.,"Operon-like arrangements of genes occur in eukaryotes ranging from yeasts and filamentous fungi to nematodes, plants, and mammals. In plants, several examples of operon-like gene clusters involved in metabolic pathways have recently been characterized, e.g. the cyclic hydroxamic acid pathways in maize, the avenacin biosynthesis gene clusters in oat, the thalianol pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, and the diterpenoid momilactone cluster in rice. Such operon-like gene clusters are defined by their co-regulation or neighboring positions within immediate vicinity of chromosomal regions. A comprehensive analysis of the expression of neighboring genes therefore accounts a crucial step to reveal the complete set of operon-like gene clusters within a genome. Genome-wide prediction of operon-like gene clusters should contribute to functional annotation efforts and provide novel insight into evolutionary aspects acquiring certain biological functions as well. We predicted co-expressed gene clusters by comparing the Pearson correlation coefficient of neighboring genes and randomly selected gene pairs, based on a statistical method that takes false discovery rate (FDR) into consideration for 1469 microarray gene expression datasets of A. thaliana. We estimated that A. thaliana contains 100 operon-like gene clusters in total. We predicted 34 statistically significant gene clusters consisting of 3 to 22 genes each, based on a stringent FDR threshold of 0.1. Functional relationships among genes in individual clusters were estimated by sequence similarity and functional annotation of genes. Duplicated gene pairs (determined based on BLAST with a cutoff of E<10(-5)) are included in 27 clusters. Five clusters are associated with metabolism, containing P450 genes restricted to the Brassica family and predicted to be involved in secondary metabolism. Operon-like clusters tend to include genes encoding bio-machinery associated with ribosomes, the ubiquitin/proteasome system, secondary metabolic pathways, lipid and fatty-acid metabolism, and the lipid transfer system.",2012-08-17,"Antigens, Plant, Arabidopsis, Arabidopsis Proteins, Brassica, Carrier Proteins, Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System, False Positive Reactions, Fatty Acids, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Lipid Metabolism, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Models, Genetic, Multigene Family, Operon, Plant Proteins, Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex, Ribosomes, Ubiquitin",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.043,Wada

It is urgent to find an effective way to understand the genetic etiology of OA. We used weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) to explore the key genes involved in the subchondral bone pathological process of OA. Fifty gene expression profiles of GSE51588 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The OA-associated genes and gene ontologies were acquired from JuniorDoc. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was used to find disease-related networks based on 21756 gene expression correlation coefficients, hub-genes with the highest connectivity in each module were selected, and the correlation between module eigengene and clinical traits was calculated. The genes in the traits-related gene coexpression modules were subject to functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis using ClusterProfiler. A total of 73 gene modules were identified, of which, 12 modules were found with high connectivity with clinical traits. Five modules were found with enriched OA-associated genes. Moreover, 310 OA-associated genes were found, and 34 of them were among hub-genes in each module. Consequently, enrichment results indicated some key metabolic pathways, such as extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interaction (hsa04512), focal adhesion (hsa04510), the phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)-Akt signaling pathway (PI3K-AKT) (hsa04151), transforming growth factor beta pathway, and Wnt pathway. We intended to identify some core genes, collagen (COL)6A3, COL6A1, ITGA11, BAMBI, and HCK, which could influence downstream signaling pathways once they were activated. In this study, we identified important genes within key coexpression modules, which associate with a pathological process of subchondral bone in OA.

Bioinformatics studies have been widely used for screening genes involved in the initiation and progression of HCC. MATERIAL AND METHODS We obtained liver cancer microarray raw data from the GEO database (GSE54238). Next, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to assess the critical modules. Then, we assessed the gene significance by calculating survival, expression level, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) in the TCGA database. We also validated the expression of selected genes in the Oncomine database and calculated the relationship between 4 hub genes and immune infiltration. Finally, GSEA enrichment analysis was used to explore the potential mechanism. RESULTS We identified the red and blue modules as the critical modules, and found 176 candidate genes by assessing gene significance. GO and KEEG results suggested that the candidate genes are involved in the cell cycle. Four hub genes - SOX4, STK39, TARBP1, and TDRKH - were eventually screened after validating their expression and power in diagnosing HCC in the TCGA database. Immune infiltration analysis and GSEA enrichment analysis showed that these 4 hub genes were correlated with the immune cell populations infiltration and that multiple mechanisms were involved, such as angiogenesis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

The objective of this study was to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in OPLL patient ligament cells and identify the target sites for the prevention and treatment of OPLL in clinic. Gene expression data GSE5464 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus; then DEGs were screened by limma package in R language, and changed functions and pathways of OPLL cells compared to normal cells were identified by DAVID (The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery); finally, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed by string. A total of 1536 DEGs were screened, with 31 down-regulated and 1505 up-regulated genes. Response to wounding function and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway may involve in the development of OPLL. Genes, such as PDGFB, PRDX2 may involve in OPLL through response to wounding function. Toll-like receptor signaling pathway enriched genes such as TLR1, TLR5, and TLR7 may involve in spine cord injury in OPLL.

30942461,Identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in rat skeletal muscle following sciatic nerve crush injury.,"Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) is a molecular biological method used to assess gene expression characterized by high simplicity, effectiveness, specificity and sensitivity. The selection of a suitable reference gene for normalization is critical for the accuracy of quantitative results. Peripheral nerve injury is a common clinical disorder that affects multiple tissues and organs, including peripheral nerves, neurons and the innervated muscles. Numerous genes are differentially expressed in skeletal muscles during muscle denervation and reinnervation following peripheral nerve injury. The identification of a suitable reference gene in innervated muscles following nerve injury may improve the understanding of the alterations in gene expression in the processes of peripheral nerve repair and regeneration. Therefore, in the present study, by using a rat sciatic nerve crush model, the expression levels of various housekeeping genes were examined. In particular, the expression levels of 13 housekeeping genes, including 18S ribosomal RNA, actin β, ankyrin repeat domain 27, cyclophilin A, GAPDH, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L10, phosphoglycerate kinase 1, RPTOR independent companion of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 2, TATA‑box binding protein, ubiquitin C, UBX domain protein 11 and tyrosine 3‑monooxygenase/tryptophan 5‑monooxygenase activation protein ζ, were investigated in gastrocnemius muscles. The geNorm and NormFinder analyses suggested that the expression level of HPRT1 was particularly stable in gastrocnemius muscles following rat sciatic nerve crush injury. Therefore, HPRT1 may be used as a reference gene for the normalization of gene expression data generated by RT‑qPCR.",2019-07-30,"Animals, Disease Models, Animal, Female, Gene Expression, Genes, Essential, Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase, Muscle, Skeletal, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley, Reference Standards, Sciatic Neuropathy",Mol Med Rep,,Wang

28526948,An innovative strategy to clone positive modifier genes of defects caused by mtDNA mutations: MRPS18C as suppressor gene of m.3946G>A mutation in MT-ND1 gene.,"We have developed a new functional complementation approach to clone modifier genes which overexpression is able to suppress the biochemical defects caused by mtDNA mutations (suppressor genes). This strategy consists in transferring human genes into respiratory chain-deficient fibroblasts, followed by a metabolic selection in a highly selective medium. We used a normalized expression cDNA library in an episomal vector (pREP4) to transfect the fibroblasts, and a medium with glutamine and devoid of any carbohydrate source to select metabolically. Growing the patient's fibroblasts in this selective medium, the deficient cells rapidly disappear unless they are rescued by the cDNA of a suppressor gene. The use of an episomal vector allows us to carry out several rounds of transfection/selection (cyclical phenotypic rescue) to enrich the rescue with true clones of suppressor genes. Using fibroblasts from a patient with epileptic encephalopathy with the m.3946G>A (p.E214K) mutation in the MT-ND1 gene, several candidate genes were identified and one of them was characterized functionally. Thus, overexpression of MRPS18C gene (that encode for bS18m protein) suppressed the molecular defects produced by this mtDNA mutation, recovering the complex I activity and reducing the ROS produced by this complex to normal levels. We suggest that modulation of bS18m expression may be an effective therapeutic strategy for the patients with this mutation.",2017-08-14,"Cells, Cultured, DNA, Mitochondrial, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Library, Genes, Modifier, Genes, Suppressor, Humans, Mitochondrial Proteins, Mutation, NADH Dehydrogenase, RNA, Long Noncoding, Reactive Oxygen Species, Ribosomal Proteins, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Transfection",Hum Genet,,Rodríguez-García

26744215,Gene Duplicability of Core Genes Is Highly Consistent across All Angiosperms.,"Gene duplication is an important mechanism for adding to genomic novelty. Hence, which genes undergo duplication and are preserved following duplication is an important question. It has been observed that gene duplicability, or the ability of genes to be retained following duplication, is a nonrandom process, with certain genes being more amenable to survive duplication events than others. Primarily, gene essentiality and the type of duplication (small-scale versus large-scale) have been shown in different species to influence the (long-term) survival of novel genes. However, an overarching view of ""gene duplicability"" is lacking, mainly due to the fact that previous studies usually focused on individual species and did not account for the influence of genomic context and the time of duplication. Here, we present a large-scale study in which we investigated duplicate retention for 9178 gene families shared between 37 flowering plant species, referred to as angiosperm core gene families. For most gene families, we observe a strikingly consistent pattern of gene duplicability across species, with gene families being either primarily single-copy or multicopy in all species. An intermediate class contains gene families that are often retained in duplicate for periods extending to tens of millions of years after whole-genome duplication, but ultimately appear to be largely restored to singleton status, suggesting that these genes may be dosage balance sensitive. The distinction between single-copy and multicopy gene families is reflected in their functional annotation, with single-copy genes being mainly involved in the maintenance of genome stability and organelle function and multicopy genes in signaling, transport, and metabolism. The intermediate class was overrepresented in regulatory genes, further suggesting that these represent putative dosage-balance-sensitive genes.

Ralstonia pseudosolanacearum (R. pseudosolanacearum) is an important plant pathogen, infecting >450 plant species and causing bacterial wilt. In order to identify stable reference genes in R. pseudosolanacearum CQPS-1 under different environment stresses. We used five tools (△Ct method, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder) to evaluate the stability of seven candidate reference genes including phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 16S ribosomal RNA (16S), cell division protein ftsZ (ftsZ), DNA gyrase subunit A (gyrA), Ribosomal protein L13 (rplM), and phosphoserine aminotransferase (serC) under biotic (growth phases) and abiotic stress (temperature, hydroxycoumarins, nutrition). Overall, gyrA and serC were the most stable genes under different growth phases, while serC, gyrA and ftsZ during temperature stress, gyrA, ftsZ and 16S under hydroxycoumarins stress, and serC and 16S under nutrition stress conditions.

30370873,Screening of reference genes using real-time quantitative PCR for gene expression studies in ,"A stable reference gene is a key prerequisite for accurate assessment of gene expression. At present, the real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction has been widely used in the analysis of gene expression in a variety of organisms. Neoseiulus barkeri Hughes (Acari: Phytoseiidae) is a major predator of mites on many important economically crops. Until now, however, there are no reports evaluating the stability of reference genes in this species. In view of this, we used GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software tools to evaluate the expression stability of 11 candidate reference genes in developmental stages and under various abiotic stresses. According to our results, β-ACT and Hsp40 were the top two stable reference genes in developmental stages. The Hsp60 and Hsp90 were the most stable reference genes in various acaricides stress.

29072883,Highly interwoven communities of a gene regulatory network unveil topologically important genes for maize seed development.,"The complex interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and their target genes in a spatially and temporally specific manner are crucial to all cellular processes. Reconstruction of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) from gene expression profiles can help to decipher TF-gene regulations in a variety of contexts; however, the inevitable prediction errors of GRNs hinder optimal data mining of RNA-Seq transcriptome profiles. Here we perform an integrative study of Zea mays (maize) seed development in order to identify key genes in a complex developmental process. First, we reverse engineered a GRN from 78 maize seed transcriptome profiles. Then, we studied collective gene interaction patterns and uncovered highly interwoven network communities as the building blocks of the GRN. One community, composed of mostly unknown genes interacting with opaque2, brittle endosperm1 and shrunken2, contributes to seed phenotypes. Another community, composed mostly of genes expressed in the basal endosperm transfer layer, is responsible for nutrient transport. We further integrated our inferred GRN with gene expression patterns in different seed compartments and at various developmental stages and pathways. The integration facilitated a biological interpretation of the GRN. Our yeast one-hybrid assays verified six out of eight TF-promoter bindings in the reconstructed GRN. This study identified topologically important genes in interwoven network communities that may be crucial to maize seed development.",2018-08-01,"Endosperm, Gene Regulatory Networks, Plant Proteins, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Seeds, Transcription Factors, Transcriptome, Zea mays",Plant J,10.1111/tpj.13750,Xiong
30704472,Comparison of different functional prediction scores using a gene-based permutation model for identifying cancer driver genes.,"Identifying cancer driver genes (CDG) is a crucial step in cancer genomic toward the advancement of precision medicine. However, driver gene discovery is a very challenging task because we are not only dealing with huge amount of data; but we are also faced with the complexity of the disease including the heterogeneity of background somatic mutation rate in each cancer patient. It is generally accepted that CDG harbor variants conferring growth advantage in the malignant cell and they are positively selected, which are critical to cancer development; whereas, non-driver genes harbor random mutations with no functional consequence on cancer. Based on this fact, function prediction based approaches for identifying CDG have been proposed to interrogate the distribution of functional predictions among mutations in cancer genomes (eLS 1-16, 2016). Assuming most of the observed mutations are passenger mutations and given the quantitative predictions for the functional impact of the mutations, genes enriched of functional or deleterious mutations are more likely to be drivers. The promises of these methods have been continually refined and can therefore be applied to increase accuracy in detecting new candidate CDGs. However, current function prediction based approaches only focus on coding mutations and lack a systematic way to pick the best mutation deleteriousness prediction algorithms for usage.",2020-05-11,"Genes, Neoplasm, Genomics, Humans, Models, Genetic",BMC Med Genomics,,Nono

26626937,Querying Co-regulated Genes on Diverse Gene Expression Datasets Via Biclustering.,"Rapid development and increasing popularity of gene expression microarrays have resulted in a number of studies on the discovery of co-regulated genes. One important way of discovering such co-regulations is the query-based search since gene co-expressions may indicate a shared role in a biological process. Although there exist promising query-driven search methods adapting clustering, they fail to capture many genes that function in the same biological pathway because microarray datasets are fraught with spurious samples or samples of diverse origin, or the pathways might be regulated under only a subset of samples. On the other hand, a class of clustering algorithms known as biclustering algorithms which simultaneously cluster both the items and their features are useful while analyzing gene expression data, or any data in which items are related in only a subset of their samples. This means that genes need not be related in all samples to be clustered together. Because many genes only interact under specific circumstances, biclustering may recover the relationships that traditional clustering algorithms can easily miss. In this chapter, we briefly summarize the literature using biclustering for querying co-regulated genes. Then we present a novel biclustering approach and evaluate its performance by a thorough experimental analysis.

31745559,The DEAD-box RNA helicase SHI2 functions in repression of salt-inducible genes and regulation of cold-inducible gene splicing.,"Gene regulation is central for growth, development, and adaptation to environmental changes in all living organisms. Many genes are induced by environmental cues, and the expression of these inducible genes is often repressed under normal conditions. Here, we show that the SHINY2 (SHI2) gene is important for repressing salt-inducible genes and also plays a role in cold response. The shi2 mutant displayed hypersensitivity to cold, abscisic acid (ABA), and LiCl. Map-based cloning demonstrates that SHI2 encodes a DEAD- (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box RNA helicase with similarity to a yeast splicing factor. Transcriptomic analysis of the shi2 mutant in response to cold revealed that the shi2 mutation decreased the number of cold-responsive genes and the magnitude of their response, and resulted in the mis-splicing of some cold-responsive genes. Under salt stress, however, the shi2 mutation increased the number of salt-responsive genes but had a negligible effect on mRNA splicing. Our results suggest that SHI2 is a component in a ready-for-transcription repressor complex important for gene repression under normal conditions, and for gene activation and transcription under stress conditions. In addition, SHI2 also serves as a splicing factor required for proper splicing of cold-responsive genes and affects 5' capping and polyadenylation site selection.",,,J Exp Bot,,Wang

Here, fourteen sucrose synthase (SUS) genes have been identified in the allotetraploid genome of Indian mustard, Brassica juncea. The identified SUS genes in B. juncea (BjSUS) were derived from the two-progenitor species, B. rapa and B. nigra. Intron-exon analysis indicated loss or gain of 1-3 introns in diversification of SUS gene family. Phylogenetic analysis revealed discrete evolutionary paths for the BjSUS genes, originating from three ancestor groups, SUS I, SUS II and SUS III. Gene expression study revealed significant variability in expression of the BjSUS paralogs across the different tissues. BjSUS genes showed transcriptional activation in response to defense hormones and a late response to wounding. Tissue and temporal specificity of expression revealed importance of specific SUS paralogs at different developmental stages and under different stress conditions.

30950127,Imputed gene associations identify replicable trans-acting genes enriched in transcription pathways and complex traits.,"Regulation of gene expression is an important mechanism through which genetic variation can affect complex traits. A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation. Much progress has been made in uncovering cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), but trans-eQTL have been more difficult to identify and replicate. Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans-acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis-acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available Genotype-Tissue Expression Project tissues and find 2,356 trans-acting/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans-acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans-acting genes are more significantly associated with selected complex traits and diseases than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects. Our scripts and summary statistics are publicly available for future studies of trans-acting gene regulation.",2019-11-14,"Cardiovascular Diseases, Chromosome Mapping, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Association Studies, Genome, Human, Humans, Multifactorial Inheritance, Quantitative Trait Loci, Trans-Activators, Transcription, Genetic, Transcriptome",Genet Epidemiol,,Wheeler
27762073,Cognitive analysis of schizophrenia risk genes that function as epigenetic regulators of gene expression.,"Epigenetic mechanisms are an important heritable and dynamic means of regulating various genomic functions, including gene expression, to orchestrate brain development, adult neurogenesis, and synaptic plasticity. These processes when perturbed are thought to contribute to schizophrenia pathophysiology. A core feature of schizophrenia is cognitive dysfunction. For genetic disorders where cognitive impairment is more severe such as intellectual disability, there are a disproportionally high number of genes involved in the epigenetic regulation of gene transcription. Evidence now supports some shared genetic aetiology between schizophrenia and intellectual disability. GWAS have identified 108 chromosomal regions associated with schizophrenia risk that span 350 genes. This study identified genes mapping to those loci that have epigenetic functions, and tested the risk alleles defining those loci for association with cognitive deficits. We developed a list of 350 genes with epigenetic functions and cross-referenced this with the GWAS loci. This identified eight candidate genes: BCL11B, CHD7, EP300, EPC2, GATAD2A, KDM3B, RERE, SATB2. Using a dataset of Irish psychosis cases and controls (n = 1235), the schizophrenia risk SNPs at these loci were tested for effects on IQ, working memory, episodic memory, and attention. Strongest associations were for rs6984242 with both measures of IQ (P = 0.001) and episodic memory (P = 0.007). We link rs6984242 to CHD7 via a long range eQTL. These associations were not replicated in independent samples.

31897123,Prognostic genes of triple-negative breast cancer identified by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by a deficiency in the estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2/neu genes. Patients with TNBC have an increased likelihood of distant recurrence and mortality, compared with patients with other subtypes of breast cancer. The current study aimed to identify novel biomarkers for TNBC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied to construct gene co-expression networks; these were used to explore the correlation between mRNA profiles and clinical data, thus identifying the most significant co-expression network associated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer-TNM stage of TNBC. Using RNAseq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas, downloaded from the University of California, Santa Cruz, WGCNA identified 23 modules via K-means clustering. The most significant module consisted of 248 genes, on which gene ontology analysis was subsequently performed. Differently Expressed Gene (DEG) analysis was then applied to determine the DEGs between normal and tumor tissues. A total of 42 genes were positioned in the overlap between DEGs and the most significant module. Following survival analysis, 5 genes [GIPC PDZ domain containing family member 1 (GIPC1), hes family bHLH transcription factor 6 (HES6), calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein family member 3 (KIAA1543), myosin light chain kinase 2 (MYLK2) and peter pan homolog (PPAN)] were selected and their association with the American Joint Committee on Cancer-TNM diagnostic stage was investigated. The expression level of these genes in different pathological stages varied, but tended to increase in more advanced pathological stages. The expression of these 5 genes exhibited accurate capacity for the identification of tumor and normal tissues via receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. High expression of GIPC1, HES6, KIAA1543, MYLK2 and PPAN resulted in poor overall survival (OS) in patients with TNBC. In conclusion, via unsupervised clustering methods, a co-expressed gene network with high inter-connectivity was constructed, and 5 genes were identified as biomarkers for TNBC.",,,Oncol Lett,,Bao

28081566,A Novel Phytophthora sojae Resistance Rps12 Gene Mapped to a Genomic Region That Contains Several Rps Genes.,"Phytophthora sojae Kaufmann and Gerdemann, which causes Phytophthora root rot, is a widespread pathogen that limits soybean production worldwide. Development of Phytophthora resistant cultivars carrying Phytophthora resistance Rps genes is a cost-effective approach in controlling this disease. For this mapping study of a novel Rps gene, 290 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (F7 families) were developed by crossing the P. sojae resistant cultivar PI399036 with the P. sojae susceptible AR2 line, and were phenotyped for responses to a mixture of three P. sojae isolates that overcome most of the known Rps genes. Of these 290 RILs, 130 were homozygous resistant, 12 heterzygous and segregating for Phytophthora resistance, and 148 were recessive homozygous and susceptible. From this population, 59 RILs homozygous for Phytophthora sojae resistance and 61 susceptible to a mixture of P. sojae isolates R17 and Val12-11 or P7074 that overcome resistance encoded by known Rps genes mapped to Chromosome 18 were selected for mapping novel Rps gene. A single gene accounted for the 1:1 segregation of resistance and susceptibility among the RILs. The gene encoding the Phytophthora resistance mapped to a 5.8 cM interval between the SSR markers BARCSOYSSR_18_1840 and Sat_064 located in the lower arm of Chromosome 18. The gene is mapped 2.2 cM proximal to the NBSRps4/6-like sequence that was reported to co-segregate with the Phytophthora resistance genes Rps4 and Rps6. The gene is mapped to a highly recombinogenic, gene-rich genomic region carrying several nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat (NBS-LRR)-like genes. We named this novel gene as Rps12, which is expected to be an invaluable resource in breeding soybeans for Phytophthora resistance.",2017-08-24,"Base Sequence, Chromosome Mapping, DNA, Plant, Disease Resistance, Genes, Plant, Microsatellite Repeats, Molecular Sequence Data, Phenotype, Phytophthora, Plant Diseases, Plant Proteins, Plant Roots, Soybeans",PLoS One,,Sahoo

25933378,A hybrid approach of gene sets and single genes for the prediction of survival risks with gene expression data.,"Accumulated biological knowledge is often encoded as gene sets, collections of genes associated with similar biological functions or pathways. The use of gene sets in the analyses of high-throughput gene expression data has been intensively studied and applied in clinical research. However, the main interest remains in finding modules of biological knowledge, or corresponding gene sets, significantly associated with disease conditions. Risk prediction from censored survival times using gene sets hasn't been well studied. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that uses both single gene and gene set information together to predict patient survival risks from gene expression profiles. In the proposed method, gene sets provide context-level information that is poorly reflected by single genes. Complementarily, single genes help to supplement incomplete information of gene sets due to our imperfect biomedical knowledge. Through the tests over multiple data sets of cancer and trauma injury, the proposed method showed robust and improved performance compared with the conventional approaches with only single genes or gene sets solely. Additionally, we examined the prediction result in the trauma injury data, and showed that the modules of biological knowledge used in the prediction by the proposed method were highly interpretable in biology. A wide range of survival prediction problems in clinical genomics is expected to benefit from the use of biological knowledge.

32336254,Covariance thresholding to detect differentially co-expressed genes from microarray gene expression data.,"Gene set analysis aims to identify differentially expressed or co-expressed genes within a biological pathway between two experimental conditions, so that it can eventually reveal biological processes and pathways involved in disease development. In the last few decades, various statistical and computational methods have been proposed to improve statistical power of gene set analysis. In recent years, much attention has been paid to differentially co-expressed genes since they can be potentially disease-related genes without significant difference in average expression levels between two conditions. In this paper, we propose a new statistical method to identify differentially co-expressed genes from microarray gene expression data. The proposed method first estimates co-expression levels of paired genes using covariance regularization by thresholding, and then significance of difference in covariance estimation between two conditions is evaluated. We demonstrated that the proposed method is more powerful than the existing main-stream methods to detect co-expressed genes through extensive simulation studies. Also, we applied it to various microarray gene expression datasets related with mutant p53 transcriptional activity, and epithelium and stroma breast cancer.",,,J Bioinform Comput Biol,10.1142/S021972002050002X,Oh

Forty-four putative candidate genes were identified with the c.v. <0·2 from all datasets. Following clustering into different functional groups, 21 genes, in addition to four conventional housekeeping genes (eef1a1l1, b2m, hrpt1l and actb1), were selected from different functional groups for further quantitative real-time (qrt-)PCR validation using 25 RNA samples from different adult tissues, developmental stages and chemical treatments. The qrt-PCR data were then analysed using the statistical algorithm refFinder for gene expression stability. Several new candidate genes showed better expression stability than the conventional housekeeping genes in all three categories. It was found that sep15 and metap1 were the top two stable genes for tissue types, ube2a and tmem50a the top two for different developmental stages, and rpl13a and rp1p0 the top two for chemical treatments. Thus, based on the extensive transcriptomic analyses and qrt-PCR validation, these new reference genes are recommended for normalization of D. rerio qrt-PCR data respectively for the three different experimental conditions.

28713914,Systematic identification of human housekeeping genes possibly useful as references in gene expression studies.,"The ideal reference, or control, gene for the study of gene expression in a given organism should be expressed at a medium‑high level for easy detection, should be expressed at a constant/stable level throughout different cell types and within the same cell type undergoing different treatments, and should maintain these features through as many different tissues of the organism. From a biological point of view, these theoretical requirements of an ideal reference gene appear to be best suited to housekeeping (HK) genes. Recent advancements in the quality and completeness of human expression microarray data and in their statistical analysis may provide new clues toward the quantitative standardization of human gene expression studies in biology and medicine, both cross‑ and within‑tissue. The systematic approach used by the present study is based on the Transcriptome Mapper tool and exploits the automated reassignment of probes to corresponding genes, intra‑ and inter‑sample normalization, elaboration and representation of gene expression values in linear form within an indexed and searchable database with a graphical interface recording quantitative levels of expression, expression variability and cross‑tissue width of expression for more than 31,000 transcripts. The present study conducted a meta‑analysis of a pool of 646 expression profile data sets from 54 different human tissues and identified actin γ 1 as the HK gene that best fits the combination of all the traditional criteria to be used as a reference gene for general use; two ribosomal protein genes, RPS18 and RPS27, and one aquaporin gene, POM121 transmembrane nucleporin C, were also identified. The present study provided a list of tissue‑ and organ‑specific genes that may be most suited for the following individual tissues/organs: Adipose tissue, bone marrow, brain, heart, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, skeletal muscle and testis; and also provides in these cases a representative, quantitative portrait of the relative, typical gene‑expression profile in the form of searchable database tables.",2018-04-30,"Adult, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Essential, Genomics, Humans, Transcriptome",Mol Med Rep,,Caracausi

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the key coding genes and long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with the survival time of GBM patients by obtaining the RNA expression profiles from the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas database and conducting weighted gene co‑expression network analysis. Modules associated with overall survival (OS) were identified, and Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed. The hub genes of these modules were validated via survival analysis, while the biological functions of crucial lncRNAs were also analysed in the publicly available data. The results identified a survival‑associated module with 195 key genes. Among them, 33 key genes were demonstrated to be associated with OS, and the majority of these were involved in extracellular matrix‑associated and tyrosine kinase receptor signalling pathways. Furthermore, LOC541471 was identified as an OS‑associated lncRNA, and was reported to be involved in the oxidative phosphorylation of GBM with pleckstrin‑2.

30460561,Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) for Functional Characterization of Disease Resistance Genes in Barley Seedlings.,"With the recent advances in sequencing technologies, many studies are generating lists of candidate genes associated with specific traits. The major bottleneck in functional genomics is the validation of gene function. This is achieved by analyzing the effect of either gene silencing or overexpression on a specific phenotypic or biochemical trait. This usually requires the generation of stable transgenic plants and this can take considerable time. Therefore any technique that expedites the validation of gene function is of particular benefit in cereals, including barley. One such technique is Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS), which evokes a natural antiviral defense mechanism in plants. VIGS can be used to downregulate gene expression in a transient manner, but long enough to determine its effects on a specific phenotype.

29681617,Gene expression profiles reveal key genes for early diagnosis and treatment of adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma.,"Adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma (ACP) is an aggressive brain tumor that occurs predominantly in the pediatric population. Conventional diagnosis method and standard therapy cannot treat ACPs effectively. In this paper, we aimed to identify key genes for ACP early diagnosis and treatment. Datasets GSE94349 and GSE68015 were obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Consensus clustering was applied to discover the gene clusters in the expression data of GSE94349 and functional enrichment analysis was performed on gene set in each cluster. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was built by the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes, and hubs were selected. Support vector machine (SVM) model was built based on the signature genes identified from enrichment analysis and PPI network. Dataset GSE94349 was used for training and testing, and GSE68015 was used for validation. Besides, RT-qPCR analysis was performed to analyze the expression of signature genes in ACP samples compared with normal controls. Seven gene clusters were discovered in the differentially expressed genes identified from GSE94349 dataset. Enrichment analysis of each cluster identified 25 pathways that highly associated with ACP. PPI network was built and 46 hubs were determined. Twenty-five pathway-related genes that overlapped with the hubs in PPI network were used as signatures to establish the SVM diagnosis model for ACP. The prediction accuracy of SVM model for training, testing, and validation data were 94, 85, and 74%, respectively. The expression of CDH1, CCL2, ITGA2, COL8A1, COL6A2, and COL6A3 were significantly upregulated in ACP tumor samples, while CAMK2A, RIMS1, NEFL, SYT1, and STX1A were significantly downregulated, which were consistent with the differentially expressed gene analysis. SVM model is a promising classification tool for screening and early diagnosis of ACP. The ACP-related pathways and signature genes will advance our knowledge of ACP pathogenesis and benefit the therapy improvement.",2019-06-20,"Craniopharyngioma, Databases, Genetic, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Male, Pituitary Neoplasms, Protein Interaction Maps, Support Vector Machine",Cancer Gene Ther,,Yang

27994121,New genes from old: asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates and the evolution of development.,"Gene duplications and gene losses have been frequent events in the evolution of animal genomes, with the balance between these two dynamic processes contributing to major differences in gene number between species. After gene duplication, it is common for both daughter genes to accumulate sequence change at approximately equal rates. In some cases, however, the accumulation of sequence change is highly uneven with one copy radically diverging from its paralogue. Such 'asymmetric evolution' seems commoner after tandem gene duplication than after whole-genome duplication, and can generate substantially novel genes. We describe examples of asymmetric evolution in duplicated homeobox genes of moths, molluscs and mammals, in each case generating new homeobox genes that were recruited to novel developmental roles. The prevalence of asymmetric divergence of gene duplicates has been underappreciated, in part, because the origin of highly divergent genes can be difficult to resolve using standard phylogenetic methods.This article is part of the themed issue 'Evo-devo in the genomics era, and the origins of morphological diversity'.",2017-11-30,"Animals, Biological Evolution, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Duplicate, Genes, Homeobox, Growth and Development",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci,,Holland

32437461,Selection and validation of reference genes for normalisation of gene expression in ischaemic and toxicological studies in kidney disease.,"Normalisation to standard reference gene(s) is essential for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to obtain reproducible and comparable results of a gene of interest (GOI) between subjects and under varying experimental conditions. There is limited evidence to support selection of the commonly used reference genes in rat ischaemic and toxicological kidney models. Employing these models, we determined the most stable reference genes by comparing 4 standard methods (NormFinder, qBase+, BestKeeper and comparative ΔCq) and developed a new 3-way linear mixed-effects model for evaluation of reference gene stability. This new technique utilises the intra-class correlation coefficient as the stability measure for multiple continuous and categorical covariates when determining the optimum normalisation factor. The model also determines confidence intervals for each candidate normalisation gene to facilitate selection and allow sample size calculation for designing experiments to identify reference genes. Of the 10 candidate reference genes tested, the geometric mean of polyadenylate-binding nuclear protein 1 (PABPN1) and beta-actin (ACTB) was the most stable reference combination. In contrast, commonly used ribosomal 18S and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were the most unstable. We compared the use of PABPN1×ACTB and 2 commonly used genes 18S and GAPDH on the expression of 4 genes of interest know to vary after renal injury and expressed by different kidney cell types (KIM-1, HIF1α, TGFβ1 and PECAM1). The less stable reference genes gave varying patterns of GOI expression in contrast to the use of the least unstable reference PABPN1×ACTB combination; this improved detection of differences in gene expression between experimental groups. Reduced within-group variation of the now more accurately normalised GOI may allow for reduced experimental group size particularly for comparison between various models. This objective selection of stable reference genes increased the reliability of comparisons within and between experimental groups.",,,PLoS One,,Herath

MATERIAL AND METHODS GEO software and the GEO2R calculation method were used to analyze two mRNA profiles, including GSE 39548 and GSE 108195. The co-expression of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified and searched in the DAVID and STRING databases for pathway and protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Cytoscape was used to draw the PPI network. DEGs were also analyzed using the Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) algorithm. Cytoscape and cytoHubba were used to analyze the hub genes and visualize the molecular interaction networks. Rats (n=20) included the IRI model group (n=10) and a control group (n=10). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to measure and compare the expression of the identified genes in rat renal tissue in the IRI model and the control group. RESULTS Ten hub genes were identified, STAT3, CD44, ITGAM, CCL2, TIMP1, MYC, THBS1, IGF1, SOCS3, and CD14. Apart from IGF1, qRT-PCR showed that expression of these genes was significantly increased in renal tissue in the rat model of IRI. The HIF-1alpha signaling pathway was involved in IRI in the rat model, which was supported by MCODE analysis.

28188868,Gene sequence variations and expression patterns of mitochondrial genes are associated with the adaptive evolution of two Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriinae) living in different high-elevation environments.,"The adaptive evolution of animals to high-elevation environments has been extensively studied in vertebrates, while few studies have focused on insects. Gynaephora species (Lepidoptera: Lymantriinae) are endemic to the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) and represent an important insect pest of alpine meadows. Here, we present a detailed comparative analysis of the mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of two Gynaephora species inhabiting different high-elevation environments: G. alpherakii and G. menyuanensis. The results indicated that the general mitogenomic features (genome size, nucleotide composition, codon usage and secondary structures of tRNAs) were well conserved between the two species. All of mitochondrial protein-coding genes were evolving under purifying selection, suggesting that selection constraints may play a role in ensuring adequate energy production. However, a number of substitutions and indels were identified that altered the protein conformations of ATP8 and NAD1, which may be the result of adaptive evolution of the two Gynaephora species to different high-elevation environments. Levels of gene expression for nine mitochondrial genes in nine different developmental stages were significantly suppressed in G. alpherakii, which lives at the higher elevation (~4800m above sea level), suggesting that gene expression patterns could be modulated by atmospheric oxygen content and environmental temperature. These results enhance our understanding of the genetic bases for the adaptive evolution of insects endemic to the QTP.",2017-03-15,"Adaptation, Physiological, Altitude, Animals, Genes, Mitochondrial, Insect Proteins, Moths, NADH Dehydrogenase, Transcriptome",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.02.014,Zhang

28338822,Gene expression atlas of pigeonpea and its application to gain insights into genes associated with pollen fertility implicated in seed formation.,"Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) is an important grain legume of the semi-arid tropics, mainly used for its protein rich seeds. To link the genome sequence information with agronomic traits resulting from specific developmental processes, a Cajanus cajan gene expression atlas (CcGEA) was developed using the Asha genotype. Thirty tissues/organs representing developmental stages from germination to senescence were used to generate 590.84 million paired-end RNA-Seq data. The CcGEA revealed a compendium of 28 793 genes with differential, specific, spatio-temporal and constitutive expression during various stages of development in different tissues. As an example to demonstrate the application of the CcGEA, a network of 28 flower-related genes analysed for cis-regulatory elements and splicing variants has been identified. In addition, expression analysis of these candidate genes in male sterile and male fertile genotypes suggested their critical role in normal pollen development leading to seed formation. Gene network analysis also identified two regulatory genes, a pollen-specific SF3 and a sucrose-proton symporter, that could have implications for improvement of agronomic traits such as seed production and yield. In conclusion, the CcGEA provides a valuable resource for pigeonpea to identify candidate genes involved in specific developmental processes and to understand the well-orchestrated growth and developmental process in this resilient crop.",2018-01-30,"Cajanus, Crops, Agricultural, Fertility, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Pollination, Seeds",J Exp Bot,,Pazhamala
31286408,Selection of Reference Genes for Normalization of Gene Expression Data in Blood of Machado-Joseph Disease/Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 3 (MJD/SCA3) Subjects.,"Alongside with the emergent clinical trials for Machado-Joseph disease/Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (MJD/SCA3) comes the need to identify molecular biomarkers of disease that can be tracked throughout the trial. MJD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat in the coding region of the ATXN3 gene. Previous findings indicate the potential of transcriptional alterations in blood of MJD patients as biomarkers of disease. Accurate quantification of gene expression levels by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) depends on data normalization, usually performed using reference genes. Because the expression level of routinely used housekeeping genes may vary in multiple biological and experimental conditions, reference gene controls should be validated in each specific experimental design. Here, we aimed to evaluate the expression behavior of five housekeeping genes previously reported as stably expressed in peripheral blood of patients from several disorders-peptidylprolyl isomerase B (PPIB), TNF receptor associated protein 1 (TRAP1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase 1 (DECR1), and folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS). Expression levels of these five genes were assessed by qPCR in blood from MJD subjects (preataxic and patients) and matched controls. While all housekeeping genes, here studied, were stably expressed in our sets of samples, TRAP1 showed to be the most stable gene by NormFinder and BestKeeper. We, therefore, conclude that any of these genes could be used as reference gene in future qPCR studies using blood samples from MJD subjects.",2020-04-20,"Adult, Case-Control Studies, Cyclophilins, Female, Gene Expression, HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins, Humans, Machado-Joseph Disease, Male, Middle Aged, Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors, Peptide Synthases, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Young Adult, beta 2-Microglobulin",J Mol Neurosci,,Ferreira

As of 2014, approximately one billion adults, or ~ 22% of the world population, have had hypertension. As of 2011, 235-330 million people globally have been affected by asthma and approximately 250,000-345,000 people have died each year from the disease. The development of the effective treatment therapies against these diseases is complicated by their comorbidity features. This is often a major problem in diagnosis and their treatment. Hence, in this study the bioinformatical methodology for the analysis of the comorbidity of these two diseases have been developed.

29241666,Identification of human circadian genes based on time course gene expression profiles by using a deep learning method.,"Circadian genes express periodically in an approximate 24-h period and the identification and study of these genes can provide deep understanding of the circadian control which plays significant roles in human health. Although many circadian gene identification algorithms have been developed, large numbers of false positives and low coverage are still major problems in this field. In this study we constructed a novel computational framework for circadian gene identification using deep neural networks (DNN) - a deep learning algorithm which can represent the raw form of data patterns without imposing assumptions on the expression distribution. Firstly, we transformed time-course gene expression data into categorical-state data to denote the changing trend of gene expression. Two distinct expression patterns emerged after clustering of the state data for circadian genes from our manually created learning dataset. DNN was then applied to discriminate the aperiodic genes and the two subtypes of periodic genes. In order to assess the performance of DNN, four commonly used machine learning methods including k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, and support vector machines were used for comparison. The results show that the DNN model achieves the best balanced precision and recall. Next, we conducted large scale circadian gene detection using the trained DNN model for the remaining transcription profiles. Comparing with JTK_CYCLE and a study performed by Möller-Levet et al. (doi: https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1217154110), we identified 1132 novel periodic genes. Through the functional analysis of these novel circadian genes, we found that the GTPase superfamily exhibits distinct circadian expression patterns and may provide a molecular switch of circadian control of the functioning of the immune system in human blood. Our study provides novel insights into both the circadian gene identification field and the study of complex circadian-driven biological control.

For an intensive investigation of the seasonal and labor-dependent expression patterns of its genes, accurate quantification of the target gene transcription level is a fundamental step. To date, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) has been widely used for rapid quantification of gene transcripts, with reliable reference gene(s) for normalization. To this end, in an attempt to search for reliable reference genes, the amplification efficiencies of six candidate reference genes (rp49, rpL32, rpS18, tbp, tub, and gapdh) were determined. Subsequently, four genes (rpL32, rpS18, tbp, and gapdh) with PCR efficiencies of 90% to 110% were evaluated for their expression stabilities with three programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) and used for normalization of seasonal expression patterns of target genes in the forager and nurse heads. Although the three programs revealed slightly different results, two genes, rpS18 and gapdh, were suggested to be the optimal reference genes for qRT-PCR-based determination of seasonal and labor-specific gene expression profiles. Furthermore, the combined use of these two genes yielded a more accurate normalization, compared with the use of a single gene in the head of honey bee. The validated reference genes can be widely used for quantification of target gene expression in honey bee head although it is still remained to be elucidated the expression levels of the selected reference genes in specific tissues in head.",2019-01-17,"Animals, Bees, Behavior, Animal, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Head, Insect Proteins, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Seasons",PLoS One,,Moon
32103340,Blood-based gene expression profile of oxidative stress and antioxidant genes for identifying surrogate markers of liver tissue injury in chronic hepatitis C patients.,"Oxidative stress is the process by which reactive molecules and free radicals are formed in cells. In this study, we report the blood-based gene expression profile of oxidative stress and antioxidant genes for identifying surrogate markers of liver tissue in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients by using real-time PCR. A total of 144 untreated patients diagnosed with CHC having genotype 3a and 20 healthy controls were selected for the present study. Liver biopsy staging and grading of CHC patients were performed using the METAVIR score. Total RNA was extracted from liver tissue and blood samples, followed by cDNA synthesis and real-time PCR. The relative expression of genes was calculated using the ΔΔCt method. The expression profile of 84 genes associated with oxidative stress and antioxidants was determined in liver tissue and blood samples. In liver tissue, 46 differentially expressed genes (upregulated, 27; downregulated, 19) were identified in CHC patients compared to normal samples. In blood, 61 genes (upregulated, 51; downregulated; 10) were significantly expressed in CHC patients. A comparison of gene expression in liver and whole blood showed that 20 genes were expressed in a similar manner in the liver and blood. The expression levels of commonly expressed liver and blood-based genes were also correlated with clinical factors in CHC patients. A receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis of oxidative stress genes (ALB, CAT, DHCR24, GPX7, PRDX5, and MBL2) showed that infections in patients with CHC can be distinguished from healthy controls. In conclusion, blood-based gene expression can reflect the behavior of oxidative stress genes in liver tissue, and this blood-based gene expression study in CHC patients explores new blood-based non-invasive biomarkers that represent liver damage.",2020-04-08,"Adult, Biomarkers, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Hepatitis C, Chronic, Humans, Liver, Male, Middle Aged, Nerve Tissue Proteins, Oxidative Stress, Oxidoreductases Acting on CH-CH Group Donors, Peroxidases, Peroxiredoxins, Young Adult",Arch Virol,,Shahid

30532199,"Identifying disease genes using machine learning and gene functional similarities, assessed through Gene Ontology.","Identifying disease genes from a vast amount of genetic data is one of the most challenging tasks in the post-genomic era. Also, complex diseases present highly heterogeneous genotype, which difficult biological marker identification. Machine learning methods are widely used to identify these markers, but their performance is highly dependent upon the size and quality of available data. In this study, we demonstrated that machine learning classifiers trained on gene functional similarities, using Gene Ontology (GO), can improve the identification of genes involved in complex diseases. For this purpose, we developed a supervised machine learning methodology to predict complex disease genes. The proposed pipeline was assessed using Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) candidate genes. A quantitative measure of gene functional similarities was obtained by employing different semantic similarity measures. To infer the hidden functional similarities between ASD genes, various types of machine learning classifiers were built on quantitative semantic similarity matrices of ASD and non-ASD genes. The classifiers trained and tested on ASD and non-ASD gene functional similarities outperformed previously reported ASD classifiers. For example, a Random Forest (RF) classifier achieved an AUC of 0. 80 for predicting new ASD genes, which was higher than the reported classifier (0.73). Additionally, this classifier was able to predict 73 novel ASD candidate genes that were enriched for core ASD phenotypes, such as autism and obsessive-compulsive behavior. In addition, predicted genes were also enriched for ASD co-occurring conditions, including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We also developed a KNIME workflow with the proposed methodology which allows users to configure and execute it without requiring machine learning and programming skills. Machine learning is an effective and reliable technique to decipher ASD mechanism by identifying novel disease genes, but this study further demonstrated that their performance can be improved by incorporating a quantitative measure of gene functional similarities.

32485038,Identification of castration-resistant prostate cancer-related hub genes using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in urinary system and brings heavy burdens in men. We downloaded gene expression profile of mRNA and related clinical data of GSE70768 data set from public database. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify the relationships between gene modules and clinical features, as well as the candidate genes. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses were developed to investigate the potential functions of related hub genes. Importantly, basic experiments were performed to verify the relationship between hub genes and the phenotype previously identified. Lastly, copy number variation (CNV) analysis was conducted to explore the genetical alteration. WGCNA identified that black module was the most relevant module which was tightly related to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) phenotype. KEGG and GO analysis results revealed genes in black module were mainly related to RNA splicing. Additionally, 9 genes were chosen as hub genes and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 (HNRNPA2B1), golgin A8 family member B (GOLGA8B) and mitogen-activated protein kinase 8 interacting protein 3 (MAPK8IP3) were identified to be associated with PCa progression and prognosis. Moreover, all above three genes were highly expressed in CRPC-like cells and their suppression led to hindered cell proliferation in vitro.

23933278,Evaluation and selection of reliable reference genes for gene expression under abiotic stress in cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.).,"Reference genes are critical for normalization of the gene expression level of target genes. The widely used housekeeping genes may change their expression levels at different tissue under different treatment or stress conditions. Therefore, systematical evaluation on the housekeeping genes is required for gene expression analysis. Up to date, no work was performed to evaluate the housekeeping genes in cotton under stress treatment. In this study, we chose 10 housekeeping genes to systematically assess their expression levels at two different tissues (leaves and roots) under two different abiotic stresses (salt and drought) with three different concentrations. Our results show that there is no best reference gene for all tissues at all stress conditions. The reliable reference gene should be selected based on a specific condition. For example, under salt stress, UBQ7, GAPDH and EF1A8 are better reference genes in leaves; TUA10, UBQ7, CYP1, GAPDH and EF1A8 were better in roots. Under drought stress, UBQ7, EF1A8, TUA10, and GAPDH showed less variety of expression level in leaves and roots. Thus, it is better to identify reliable reference genes first before performing any gene expression analysis. However, using a combination of housekeeping genes as reference gene may provide a new strategy for normalization of gene expression. In this study, we found that combination of four housekeeping genes worked well as reference genes under all the stress conditions.",2013-12-11,"Droughts, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gossypium, Plant Leaves, Plant Proteins, Plant Roots, Salinity, Stress, Physiological",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2013.07.084,Wang

The aim of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes across multiple microarray datasets (meta-DEGs), to prioritize meta-DEGs to find the most promising genes linked to acquired taxane resistance (ATR), and to analyze the relevant biological networks using topology analysis. A total of 771 meta-DEGs were identified by performing a cross-platform meta-analysis of ATR-related microarray datasets. A gene prioritization method was used to simultaneously identify activated or deactivated genes on a co-expression map and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The top 10 prioritized genes in the gene co-expression and the top 1% highly ranked genes in the PPI network were identified. The selected meta-DEGs were used to construct biological networks, and topological analysis was performed using network centrality measures. Using integrative analyses, we identified ATR candidate genes, including several previously unidentified genes that were found to be associated with ATR. From the gene co-expression network, PRSS23 was the highest-ranking gene at local average connectivity measure and ADAM9 was ranked highest in other centralities. In protein interaction network, HSPA1A, ANXA1, and PA2G4 showed highest ranks in network centrality analyses. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the gene expression patterns associated with ATR. Furthermore, it presents a new approach to identification of unveiled candidate genes to ATR, using a gene prioritization method and network analysis.",,,Crit Rev Eukaryot Gene Expr,10.1615/CritRevEukaryotGeneExpr.2019026317,Kim

Potential longevity genes are neither specific nor reproducible, and longevity-related genes are constantly confused with age-related genes. To distinguish specific age- and longevity-related genes, we analyzed a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset established by the Leiden Longevity Study. The individuals were classified into longevity (mean age, 93.4 ± 3.0 years), longevity offspring (60.8 ± 6.1) and control (61.9 ± 6.9) groups. The series matrix files were downloaded, and average expression values were calculated. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between longevity and control groups and those between longevity and their offspring were identified by GEO2R online. A total of 507 longevity- and 755 age-related DEGs were visualized using a Venn diagram. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the longevity- and age-related DEGs. Age-related color modules and genes were identified. However, no longevity-related modules or genes were found. The green module, with 46 age-related DEGs, was the most biologically significant to age and aging. Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and protein-protein interaction pathway analyses were conducted on these 46 DEGs, which are mainly enriched in B cell activation and receptor signaling pathways.

31402962,Discovery of core genes in colorectal cancer by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the interactions among messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs (miRNAs), and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in colorectal cancer (CRC), in order to examine its underlying mechanisms. The raw gene expression data was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. An online tool, GEO2R, which is based on the limma package, was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The co-expression between lncRNAs and mRNAs was identified utilizing the weighted gene co-expression analysis package of R to construct a coding non-coding (CNC) network. The function of the genes in the CNC network was determined by performing Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways enrichment analysis. The interactions among miRNAs, mRNAs and lncRNAs were predicted using Lncbase and mirWalk to construct the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network. The expression of the genes involved in the ceRNA network was further validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset. A total of 3,183 dysregulated mRNAs, 78 dysregulated miRNAs and 2,248 dysregulated lncRNAs were screened in two GEO datasets. Combined with the results of the dysregulated genes, 169 genes were selected to construct the CNC network. 'p53 signaling pathway' and the 'cell cycle' were the most significant enriched pathways in the genes involved in the CNC network. Finally, a validated ceRNA network composed of 2 lncRNAs (MIR22HG and RP11-61I13.3), 5 miRNAs (hsa-miR-765, hsa-miR-198, hsa-miR-125a-3p, hsa-miR-149-3p and hsa-miR-650) and 5 mRNAs (ANK2, BTK, GBP2, PCSK5 and PDK4) was obtained. In conclusion, MIR22HG may regulate PCSK5, BTK and PDK4, and RP11-61I13.3 may regulate the ANK2, GBP2, PCSK5 through sponging miRNAs to act on the progression of CRC, and the potential function of these genes have been revealed.

25445290,Validation of reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression for real time-quantitative PCR in strawberry fruits using different cultivars and osmotic stresses.,"The increasing demand of strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa Duch) fruits is associated mainly with their sensorial characteristics and the content of antioxidant compounds. Nevertheless, the strawberry production has been hampered due to its sensitivity to abiotic stresses. Therefore, to understand the molecular mechanisms highlighting stress response is of great importance to enable genetic engineering approaches aiming to improve strawberry tolerance. However, the study of expression of genes in strawberry requires the use of suitable reference genes. In the present study, seven traditional and novel candidate reference genes were evaluated for transcript normalization in fruits of ten strawberry cultivars and two abiotic stresses, using RefFinder, which integrates the four major currently available software programs: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and the comparative delta-Ct method. The results indicate that the expression stability is dependent on the experimental conditions. The candidate reference gene DBP (DNA binding protein) was considered the most suitable to normalize expression data in samples of strawberry cultivars and under drought stress condition, and the candidate reference gene HISTH4 (histone H4) was the most stable under osmotic stresses and salt stress. The traditional genes GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and 18S (18S ribosomal RNA) were considered the most unstable genes in all conditions. The expression of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) and 9-cis epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1) genes were used to further confirm the validated candidate reference genes, showing that the use of an inappropriate reference gene may induce erroneous results. This study is the first survey on the stability of reference genes in strawberry cultivars and osmotic stresses and provides guidelines to obtain more accurate RT-qPCR results for future breeding efforts.

The data of the patients with CRC were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and assessed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses performed in R. by WGCNA, several hub genes that regulate the mechanism of tumorigenesis in CRC were identified, which were associated with clinical traits. Next, we screened hub genes related to the progression of CRC authenticated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Oncomine databases. Three hub genes (HCLS1, EVI2B, and CD48) were identified, and survival analysis was further performed. Moreover, the results of qPCR and immunohistochemistry staining revealed that HCLS1, EVI2B, and CD48 are tumor suppressor genes.

28873455,Prediction and analysis of essential genes using the enrichments of gene ontology and KEGG pathways.,"Identifying essential genes in a given organism is important for research on their fundamental roles in organism survival. Furthermore, if possible, uncovering the links between core functions or pathways with these essential genes will further help us obtain deep insight into the key roles of these genes. In this study, we investigated the essential and non-essential genes reported in a previous study and extracted gene ontology (GO) terms and biological pathways that are important for the determination of essential genes. Through the enrichment theory of GO and KEGG pathways, we encoded each essential/non-essential gene into a vector in which each component represented the relationship between the gene and one GO term or KEGG pathway. To analyze these relationships, the maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) was adopted. Then, the incremental feature selection (IFS) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to extract important GO terms and KEGG pathways. A prediction model was built simultaneously using the extracted GO terms and KEGG pathways, which yielded nearly perfect performance, with a Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.951, for distinguishing essential and non-essential genes. To fully investigate the key factors influencing the fundamental roles of essential genes, the 21 most important GO terms and three KEGG pathways were analyzed in detail. In addition, several genes was provided in this study, which were predicted to be essential genes by our prediction model. We suggest that this study provides more functional and pathway information on the essential genes and provides a new way to investigate related problems.",2017-10-16,"Gene Ontology, Genes, Essential, Reproducibility of Results, Signal Transduction, Support Vector Machine",PLoS One,,Chen
29773659,Modeling leaderless transcription and atypical genes results in more accurate gene prediction in prokaryotes.,"In a conventional view of the prokaryotic genome organization, promoters precede operons and ribosome binding sites (RBSs) with Shine-Dalgarno consensus precede genes. However, recent experimental research suggesting a more diverse view motivated us to develop an algorithm with improved gene-finding accuracy. We describe GeneMarkS-2, an ab initio algorithm that uses a model derived by self-training for finding species-specific (native) genes, along with an array of precomputed ""heuristic"" models designed to identify harder-to-detect genes (likely horizontally transferred). Importantly, we designed GeneMarkS-2 to identify several types of distinct sequence patterns (signals) involved in gene expression control, among them the patterns characteristic for leaderless transcription as well as noncanonical RBS patterns. To assess the accuracy of GeneMarkS-2, we used genes validated by COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups) annotation, proteomics experiments, and N-terminal protein sequencing. We observed that GeneMarkS-2 performed better on average in all accuracy measures when compared with the current state-of-the-art gene prediction tools. Furthermore, the screening of ∼5000 representative prokaryotic genomes made by GeneMarkS-2 predicted frequent leaderless transcription in both archaea and bacteria. We also observed that the RBS sites in some species with leadered transcription did not necessarily exhibit the Shine-Dalgarno consensus. The modeling of different types of sequence motifs regulating gene expression prompted a division of prokaryotic genomes into five categories with distinct sequence patterns around the gene starts.",2018-10-24,"Algorithms, Archaea, Bacteria, Binding Sites, Computational Biology, Genes, Bacterial, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Operon, Prokaryotic Cells, Protein Biosynthesis, Proteomics, Ribosomes, Transcription, Genetic",Genome Res,,Lomsadze

Six commonly used housekeeping genes including actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ubiquitin (UBQ), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (UCE), α-tubulin (α-TUB) and β-tubulin (β-TUB) were selected to test their expression stabilities in B. cinerea treated with different concentration of oxalic acid (1, 5 and 10mM) and confronted with antagonistic Trichoderma afroharzianum. Four in silico algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and Comparative ΔCt) were applied to evaluate the expression stabilities of these genes, and the UBQ gene was identified as the most stably expressed.

Relative quantification of gene expression is the preferred method for quantitative validation of potential biomarkers. However, this approach relies on robust tissue-specific reference genes. In the melanoma field, this has been an obstacle due to lack of validated reference genes. Accordingly, we aimed to identify robust reference genes for normalization of gene expression in melanoma. The robustness of 24 candidate reference genes was evaluated across 80 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded melanomas of different thickness, -/+ ulceration, -/+ reported cases of metastases and of different BRAF mutation status using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of the same genes and their robustness as normalizers was furthermore evaluated across a number of melanoma cell lines. We show that housekeeping genes like GAPDH do not qualify as stand-alone normalizers of genes expression in melanoma. Instead, we have as the first identified a panel of robust reference genes for normalization of gene expression in melanoma tumors and cultured melanoma cells. We recommend using a geometric mean of the expression of CLTA, MRPL19 and ACTB for normalization of gene expression in melanomas and a geometric mean of the expression of CASC3 and RPS2 for normalization of gene expression in melanoma cell lines. Normalization, according to our recommendation will allow for quantitative validation of potential novel melanoma biomarkers by quantitative real-time PCR.",,,Melanoma Res,,Christensen
28541580,"Genes and gene clusters related to genotype and drought-induced variation in saccharification potential, lignin content and wood anatomical traits in Populus nigra.","Wood is a renewable resource that can be employed for the production of second generation biofuels by enzymatic saccharification and subsequent fermentation. Knowledge on how the saccharification potential is affected by genotype-related variation of wood traits and drought is scarce. Here, we used three Populus nigra L. genotypes from habitats differing in water availability to (i) investigate the relationships between wood anatomy, lignin content and saccharification and (ii) identify genes and co-expressed gene clusters related to genotype and drought-induced variation in wood traits and saccharification potential. The three poplar genotypes differed in wood anatomy, lignin content and saccharification potential. Drought resulted in reduced cambial activity, decreased vessel and fiber lumina, and increased the saccharification potential. The saccharification potential was unrelated to lignin content as well as to most wood anatomical traits. RNA sequencing of the developing xylem revealed that 1.5% of the analyzed genes were differentially expressed in response to drought, while 67% differed among the genotypes. Weighted gene correlation network analysis identified modules of co-expressed genes correlated with saccharification potential. These modules were enriched in gene ontology terms related to cell wall polysaccharide biosynthesis and modification and vesicle transport, but not to lignin biosynthesis. Among the most strongly saccharification-correlated genes, those with regulatory functions, especially kinases, were prominent. We further identified transcription factors whose transcript abundances differed among genotypes, and which were co-regulated with genes for biosynthesis and modifications of hemicelluloses and pectin. Overall, our study suggests that the regulation of pectin and hemicellulose metabolism is a promising target for improving wood quality of second generation bioenergy crops.

29739919,Identification of Core Genes and Key Pathways via Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and DNA Methylation Profiles in Bladder Cancer.,"BACKGROUND Bladder cancer (BC) is the most common urological malignant tumor. In BC, aberrant DNA methylation is believed to be associated with carcinogenesis. Therefore, the identification of key genes and pathways could help determine the potential molecular mechanisms of BC development. MATERIAL AND METHODS Microarray data on gene expression and gene methylation were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Abnormal methylated/expressed genes were analyzed by GEO2R and statistical software R. Gene Ontology term enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed using the DAVID database and KOBAS 3.0. STRING and Cytoscape software were used to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and analyze modules of the PPI network. RESULTS A total of 71 hypomethylated/upregulated genes were significantly enriched in cell-cell adhesion and blood vessel development. KEGG pathway analysis highlighted p53 signaling and metabolic pathways. Five core genes in the PPI network were determined: CDH1, DDOST, CASP8, DHX15, and PTPRF. Additionally, 89 hypermethylated/downregulated genes were found. These genes were enriched mostly in cell adhesion and signal transduction. KEGG pathway analysis revealed enrichment in focal adhesion. The top 5 core genes in the PPI network were GNG4, ADCY9, NPY, ADRA2B, and PENK. We found most of the core genes were also significantly altered in the Cancer Genome Atlas database. CONCLUSIONS Abnormal methylated/expressed genes and key signaling pathways involved in BC were identified through integrated bioinformatics analysis.

29744525,Mapping of a dominant rust resistance gene revealed two R genes around the major Rust_QTL in cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.).,"A consensus rust QTL was identified within a 1.25 cM map interval of A03 chromosome in cultivated peanut. This map interval contains a TIR-NB-LRR R gene and four pathogenesis-related genes. Disease resistance in plants is manifested due to the specific interaction between the R gene product and its cognate avirulence gene product (AVR) in the pathogen. Puccinia arachidis Speg. causes rust disease and inflicts economic damages to peanut. Till now, no experimental evidence is known for the action of R gene in peanut for rust resistance. A fine mapping approach towards the development of closely linked markers for rust resistance gene was undertaken in this study. Phenotyping of an RIL population at five environments for field rust score and subsequent QTL analysis has identified a 1.25 cM map interval that harbored a consensus major Rust_QTL in A03 chromosome. This Rust_QTL is flanked by two SSR markers: FRS72 and SSR_GO340445. Both the markers clearly identified strong association of the mapped region with rust reaction in both resistant and susceptible genotypes from a collection of 95 cultivated peanut germplasm. This 1.25 cM map interval contained 331.7 kb in the physical map of A. duranensis and had a TIR-NB-LRR category R gene (Aradu.Z87JB) and four glucan endo-1,3 β glucosidase genes (Aradu.RKA6 M, Aradu.T44NR, Aradu.IWV86 and Aradu.VG51Q). Another resistance gene analog was also found in the vicinity of mapped Rust_QTL. The sequence between SSR markers, FRS72 and FRS49, contains an LRR-PK (Aradu.JG217) which is equivalent to RHG4 in soybean. Probably, the protein kinase domain in AhRHG4 acts as an integrated decoy for the cognate AVR from Puccinia arachidis and helps the TIR-NB-LRR R-protein to initiate a controlled program cell death in resistant peanut plants.",2019-04-18,"Arachis, Basidiomycota, Chromosome Mapping, Disease Resistance, Genes, Dominant, Genes, Plant, Genetic Linkage, Genetic Markers, Microsatellite Repeats, Phenotype, Plant Diseases, Quantitative Trait Loci",Theor Appl Genet,,Mondal
29943288,Genome-wide identification of the pectate lyase-like (PLL) gene family and functional analysis of two PLL genes in rice.,"Pectate lyase catalyses the eliminative cleavage of de-esterified pectin, which is a major component of primary cell walls in many higher plants. Pectate lyase-like (PLL) genes have been identified in various plant species and are involved in a broad range of physiological processes associated with pectin degradation. Previous studies have functionally identified two PLL genes in rice (Oryza sativa. L). However, the knowledge concerning genome-wide analysis of this family remains limited, and functions of the other PLL genes have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. In this study, we identified 12 PLL genes based on a genome-wide investigation in rice. A complete overview of this gene family is presented, including chromosomal locations, exon-intron structure, cis-acting elements and conserved motifs. PLL protein sequences from multiple plant species were compared and divided into five groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that only a portion of OsPLL genes (4 of 12) exhibits detectable expression levels. Notably, OsPLL1, OsPLL3, OsPLL4 and OsPLL12 exhibit strong and preferential expression in panicles suggesting that the potential roles of these genes are crucial during rice panicle development. Moreover, knockdown of OsPLL3 and OsPLL4 by artificial microRNA (amiRNA) disrupted normal pollen development and resulted in partial male sterility. These results could provide valuable information for characterising the functions and dissecting the molecular mechanisms of the OsPLL genes.",2018-12-11,"Amino Acid Sequence, Base Sequence, Chromosome Mapping, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Multigene Family, Oryza, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Plants, Genetically Modified, Polysaccharide-Lyases",Mol Genet Genomics,,Zheng

The incidence of RCC has increased steadily in recent years. The pathogenesis of renal cell cancer remains poorly understood. Many of the tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and dysregulated pathways in ccRCC need to be revealed for improvement of the overall clinical outlook of the disease. Here, we developed a systems biology approach to prioritize the somatic mutated genes that lead to dysregulation of pathways in ccRCC. The method integrated multi-layer information to infer causative mutations and disease genes. First, we identified differential gene modules in ccRCC by coupling transcriptome and protein-protein interactions. Each of these modules consisted of interacting genes that were involved in similar biological processes and their combined expression alterations were significantly associated with disease type.

26472671,Evaluation of Suitable Reference Genes for Normalization of qPCR Gene Expression Studies in Brinjal (Solanum melongena L.) During Fruit Developmental Stages.,"Brinjal/eggplant/aubergine is one of the major solanaceous vegetable crops. Recent availability of genome information greatly facilitates the fundamental research on brinjal. Gene expression patterns during different stages of fruit development can provide clues towards the understanding of its biological functions. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) has become one of the most widely used methods for rapid and accurate quantification of gene expression. However, its success depends on the use of a suitable reference gene for data normalization. For qPCR analysis, a single reference gene is not universally suitable for all experiments. Therefore, reference gene validation is a crucial step. Suitable reference genes for qPCR analysis of brinjal fruit development have not been investigated so far. In this study, we have selected 21 candidate reference genes from the Brinjal (Solanum melongena) Plant Gene Indices database (compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/plant.html) and studied their expression profiles by qPCR during six different fruit developmental stages (0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 50 days post anthesis) along with leaf samples of the Pusa Purple Long (PPL) variety. To evaluate the stability of gene expression, geNorm and NormFinder analytical softwares were used. geNorm identified SAND (SAND family protein) and TBP (TATA binding protein) as the best pairs of reference genes in brinjal fruit development. The results showed that for brinjal fruit development, individual or a combination of reference genes should be selected for data normalization. NormFinder identified Expressed gene (expressed sequence) as the best single reference gene in brinjal fruit development. In this study, we have identified and validated for the first time reference genes to provide accurate transcript normalization and quantification at various fruit developmental stages of brinjal which can also be useful for gene expression studies in other Solanaceae plant species.

No matter for traditional blotting analysis or currently commonly used PCR strategy, all need a stable reference gene for normalizing the gene expression. To screen and select housekeeping genes as the most stable reference genes, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to analyze the expression of sixteen commonly used reference genes (IbelF, Ibα-tubulin, IbHIS, IbCOX, IbGAPDH, IbH2B1, IbARF, IbCYC, Ibβ-tubulin, IbACT, IbEFl-a, IbG14, IbPLD, IbRPL2, IbUBQ, IbUBI) in five different tissues under two different temperature stresses in sweet potato. Data analysis by the Delta CT, geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs revealed that IbelF is the most stable gene and IbUBI is the least stable gene as reference. Our study also shows that combination of two or more genes as reference is a better choice, rendering more substantiated expression data for comparison.

31306407,A gene co-expression network-based analysis of multiple brain tissues reveals novel genes and molecular pathways underlying major depression.,"Major depression is a common and severe psychiatric disorder with a highly polygenic genetic architecture. Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified multiple independent genetic loci that harbour variants associated with major depression, but the exact causal genes and biological mechanisms are largely unknown. Tissue-specific network approaches may identify molecular mechanisms underlying major depression and provide a biological substrate for integrative analyses. We provide a framework for the identification of individual risk genes and gene co-expression networks using genome-wide association summary statistics and gene expression information across multiple human brain tissues and whole blood. We developed a novel gene-based method called eMAGMA that leverages tissue-specific eQTL information to identify 99 biologically plausible risk genes associated with major depression, of which 58 are novel. Among these novel associations is Complement Factor 4A (C4A), recently implicated in schizophrenia through its role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development. Major depression risk genes were enriched in gene co-expression modules in multiple brain tissues and the implicated gene modules contained genes involved in synaptic signalling, neuronal development, and cell transport pathways. Modules enriched with major depression signals were strongly preserved across brain tissues, but were weakly preserved in whole blood, highlighting the importance of using disease-relevant tissues in genetic studies of psychiatric traits. We identified tissue-specific genes and gene co-expression networks associated with major depression. Our novel analytical framework can be used to gain fundamental insights into the functioning of the nervous system in major depression and other brain-related traits.",2019-12-17,"Brain Chemistry, Complement C4a, Depressive Disorder, Major, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Organ Specificity, Quantitative Trait Loci, Sequence Analysis, RNA",PLoS Genet,,Gerring
31180534,Identification of specific modules and significant genes associated with colon cancer by weighted gene co‑expression network analysis.,"Colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignancies and is a leading cause of cancer‑associated mortality. The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying colon cancer and identify potentially significant genes associated with the disease using weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA). The test datasets used were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. WGCNA was applied to analyze microarray data obtained from colon adenocarcinoma samples to identify significant modules and highly associated genes. A gene co‑expression network was constructed and different gene modules were selected. Functional and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of colon cancer. In addition, highly connected hub genes associated with the most significant module were selected for further analysis. Nine specific modules associated with colon cancer were identified, of which the turquoise module was observed to exhibit the greatest association with the disease. Pathway enrichment analysis of the turquoise module suggested that genes in the turquoise module were associated with 'RNA polymerase' and 'purine metabolism'. Furthermore, gene ontology enrichment analysis revealed the top 30 hub genes with a higher degree in the turquoise module, such as σ‑non‑opioid intracellular receptor 1, transmembrane protein 147  TMEM147) and carbamoyl‑phosphate synthetase 2, aspartate transcarbamylase, and dihydroorotase, were predominantly enriched in the biological processes 'translation' and 'gene expression'. Experimental verification demonstrated that the expression of TMEM147 in colon cancer was significantly increased compared with the control. Therefore, the results suggested that genes associated with RNA polymerase and the purine metabolic pathways may be substantially involved in the pathogenesis of colon cancer. Furthermore, TMEM147 may represent a biomarker for colon cancer.",2019-12-16,"Cluster Analysis, Colonic Neoplasms, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans",Mol Med Rep,10.3892/mmr.2019.10295,Feng

28981708,Selective Constraints on Coding Sequences of Nervous System Genes Are a Major Determinant of Duplicate Gene Retention in Vertebrates.,"The evolutionary history of vertebrates is marked by three ancient whole-genome duplications: two successive rounds in the ancestor of vertebrates, and a third one specific to teleost fishes. Biased loss of most duplicates enriched the genome for specific genes, such as slow evolving genes, but this selective retention process is not well understood. To understand what drives the long-term preservation of duplicate genes, we characterized duplicated genes in terms of their expression patterns. We used a new method of expression enrichment analysis, TopAnat, applied to in situ hybridization data from thousands of genes from zebrafish and mouse. We showed that the presence of expression in the nervous system is a good predictor of a higher rate of retention of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Further analyses suggest that purifying selection against the toxic effects of misfolded or misinteracting proteins, which is particularly strong in nonrenewing neural tissues, likely constrains the evolution of coding sequences of nervous system genes, leading indirectly to the preservation of duplicate genes after whole-genome duplication. Whole-genome duplications thus greatly contributed to the expansion of the toolkit of genes available for the evolution of profound novelties of the nervous system at the base of the vertebrate radiation.",2018-03-21,"Animals, Biological Evolution, Evolution, Molecular, Exons, Gene Duplication, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Duplicate, Genome, In Situ Hybridization, Mice, Nervous System, Neurons, Phylogeny, Vertebrates, Zebrafish",Mol Biol Evol,,Roux

28763741,Expression stability and selection of optimal reference genes for gene expression normalization in early life stage rainbow trout exposed to cadmium and copper.,"Gene expression analysis represents a powerful approach to characterize the specific mechanisms by which contaminants interact with organisms. One of the key considerations when conducting gene expression analyses using quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is the selection of appropriate reference genes, which is often overlooked. Specifically, to reach meaningful conclusions when using relative quantification approaches, expression levels of reference genes must be highly stable and cannot vary as a function of experimental conditions. However, to date, information on the stability of commonly used reference genes across developmental stages, tissues and after exposure to contaminants such as metals is lacking for many vertebrate species including teleost fish. Therefore, in this study, we assessed the stability of expression of 8 reference gene candidates in the gills and skin of three different early life-stages of rainbow trout after acute exposure (24h) to two metals, cadmium (Cd) and copper (Cu) using qPCR. Candidate housekeeping genes were: beta actin (b-actin), DNA directed RNA polymerase II subunit I (DRP2), elongation factor-1 alpha (EF1a), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8), and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S). Four algorithms, geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and the comparative ΔCt method were employed to systematically evaluate the expression stability of these candidate genes under control and exposed conditions as well as across three different life-stages. Finally, stability of genes was ranked by taking geometric means of the ranks established by the different methods. Stability of reference genes was ranked in the following order (from lower to higher stability): HPRT<GAPDH<EF1a<G6PD<RPL8<DRP2<b-actin in gills of fish exposed to Cd; b-actin<GAPDH<G6PD<DRP2<RPL8<HPRT<EF1a in gills of fish exposed to Cu; RPL8<HPRT<GAPDH<G6PD<EF1a<DRP2<b-actin in the skin of fish exposed to Cd; and EF1a<GAPDH<RPL8<HPRT<G6PD<b-actin<DRP2 in the skin of fish exposed to Cu. The results demonstrated that the stability of reference genes depended on the metal, life-stage and/or organ in question. Thus, attention should be paid to these factors before selection of reference gene for relative quantification of the gene expressions.",2017-11-20,"Animals, Cadmium, Copper, Gene Expression Profiling, Gills, Life Cycle Stages, Oncorhynchus mykiss, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Skin, Transcriptome, Water Pollutants, Chemical",Aquat Toxicol,10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.07.009,Shekh

Though existence of a universal reference gene is myth, commonly used reference genes can be assessed for expression stability to confer their suitability to be used as candidate reference genes in gene expression studies. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of ten most commonly used reference genes (GAPDH, ACTB, HSP90, HMBS, 18S rRNA, B2M, POLR2A, HPRT1, ACAC, YWHAZ) in fourteen different Peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) infected tissues of goats and sheep.

Our results suggested HMBS and B2M in goats and HMBS and HPRT1 in sheep can be used as suitable endogenous controls in gene expression studies of PPRV infection irrespective of tissues and condition as a whole, thus eliminating the use of tissue specific/ condition specific endogenous controls. We report for the first time suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in PPRV infected tissues.

The transcription stability of these genes was evaluated using NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software. Regarding expression stability, mbp1, β-act, and sdha were the most stable housekeeping genes which we recommend for future qRT-PCR studies on M. canis strains.

In this study, our aim is to identify gene modules and representative candidate biomarkers for clinical prognosis of patients with COAD, and help to predict prognosis and reveal the mechanisms of cancer progression. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct a co-expression network and identify gene modules correlated with TNM clinical staging of COAD patients. The Gene Ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis were performed with the module gene. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and hub gene identification were explored with Cytoscape software. Finally, the hub gene mRNA level was validated in Oncomine database. Five gene modules, related with the pathological TNM stage, were constructed, and the gene module was enriched in cell proliferation, invasion and migration related GO terms and metabolic related KEGG pathways. A total of top 10 hub genes was identified, and in which six of the hub genes show a significant up-regulation in COAD as compared to normal tissue, including IVL, KRT16, KRT6C, KRT6A, KRT78 and SBSN.

26149127,Bacterial reference genes for gene expression studies by RT-qPCR: survey and analysis.,"The appropriate choice of reference genes is essential for accurate normalization of gene expression data obtained by the method of reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). In 2009, a guideline called the Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) highlighted the importance of the selection and validation of more than one suitable reference gene for obtaining reliable RT-qPCR results. Herein, we searched the recent literature in order to identify the bacterial reference genes that have been most commonly validated in gene expression studies by RT-qPCR (in the first 5 years following publication of the MIQE guidelines). Through a combination of different search parameters with the text mining tool MedlineRanker, we identified 145 unique bacterial genes that were recently tested as candidate reference genes. Of these, 45 genes were experimentally validated and, in most of the cases, their expression stabilities were verified using the software tools geNorm and NormFinder. It is noteworthy that only 10 of these reference genes had been validated in two or more of the studies evaluated. An enrichment analysis using Gene Ontology classifications demonstrated that genes belonging to the functional categories of DNA Replication (GO: 0006260) and Transcription (GO: 0006351) rendered a proportionally higher number of validated reference genes. Three genes in the former functional class were also among the top five most stable genes identified through an analysis of gene expression data obtained from the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center. These results may provide a guideline for the initial selection of candidate reference genes for RT-qPCR studies in several different bacterial species.

30108262,Gene Ontology Enrichment Improves Performances of Functional Similarity of Genes.,"There exists a plethora of measures to evaluate functional similarity (FS) between genes, which is a widely used in many bioinformatics applications including detecting molecular pathways, identifying co-expressed genes, predicting protein-protein interactions, and prioritization of disease genes. Measures of FS between genes are mostly derived from Information Contents (IC) of Gene Ontology (GO) terms annotating the genes. However, existing measures evaluating IC of terms based either on the representations of terms in the annotating corpus or on the knowledge embedded in the GO hierarchy do not consider the enrichment of GO terms by the querying pair of genes. The enrichment of a GO term by a pair of gene is dependent on whether the term is annotated by one gene (i.e., partial annotation) or by both genes (i.e. complete annotation) in the pair. In this paper, we propose a method that incorporate enrichment of GO terms by a gene pair in computing their FS and show that GO enrichment improves the performances of 46 existing FS measures in the prediction of sequence homologies, gene expression correlations, protein-protein interactions, and disease associated genes.",2019-10-28,"Base Sequence, Computational Biology, Datasets as Topic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Ontology, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Protein Interaction Mapping, Semantics",Sci Rep,,Liu

Moreover, the susceptibility to the heavy metals cadmium and copper was determined by broth macrodilution. The 49,189-bp plasmid harboured the apramycin resistance gene apmA, two copies of the macrolide/lincosamide/streptogramin B resistance gene erm(B) (both located on remnants of a truncated transposon Tn917), the kanamycin/neomycin resistance gene aadD, the tetracycline resistance gene tet(L) and the trimethoprim resistance gene dfrK. The latter three genes were part of a 7,284-bp segment which was bracketed by two copies of IS431. In addition, the cadmium resistance operon cadDX as well as the copper resistance genes copA and mco were located on the plasmid and mediated a reduced susceptibility to cadmium and copper. Moreover, a complete novel ica-like gene cluster of so far unknown genetic origin was detected on this plasmid. The ica-like gene cluster comprised four different genes whose products showed 64.4-76.9% homology to the Ica proteins known to be involved in biofilm formation of the S. aureus strains Mu50, Mu3 and N315. However, 96.2-99.4% homology was seen to proteins from S. sciuri NS1 indicating an S. sciuri origin. The finding of five different antibiotic resistance genes co-located on a plasmid with heavy metal resistance genes and an ica-like gene cluster is alarming.

In this study, we evaluated typical genes to determine whether they were effective at different levels of diatom clustering analysis to assess the potential of these regions for barcoding taxa. Our test genes included nuclear rRNA genes (the nuclear small-subunit rRNA gene and the 5.8S rRNA gene+ITS-2), a mitochondrial gene (cytochrome c-oxidase subunit 1, COI), a chloroplast gene [ribulose-1,5-biphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL)] and the universal plastid amplicon (UPA).

In a previous experiment, phenotypic differences were observed between μ-calpain knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice, including nutrient accretion and fiber type differences. These changes were particularly evident as the animals aged. Thus, we utilized 18 mice (9 KO and 9 WT) to compare transcript abundance to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 52 wk of age. A total of 55 genes were differentially expressed, including adiponectin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1, uncoupling protein 1, and lysine deficient protein kinase 2. These genes were analyzed for over- and underrepresented gene ontology (GO) terms. Several GO terms, including response to cytokine, response to interferon-beta, regulation of protein phosphorylation, and hydrolase activity, were identified as overrepresented. Pathways related to taurine biosynthesis, nitric oxide synthase signaling, amyloid processing, and L-cysteine degradation were also identified. Our results are consistent with previous experiments, in that identified DEGs may explain, at least in part, some of the phenotypic differences between μ-calpain KO and WT mice. Clearly muscle growth and maintenance are complex, multifaceted processes.

While PP2A and ABCT genes were ranked as best for different tissues, ABCT, UCP and CAC were most stable across all samples. This study demonstrated the usefulness of new generation reference genes for more accurate qPCR based gene expression quantification in cultivated as well as wild chickpea species. Validation of the best reference genes was carried out by studying their impact on normalization of aquaporin genes PIP1;4 and TIP3;1, in three contrasting chickpea genotypes under high vapor pressure deficit (VPD) treatment. The chickpea TIP3;1 gene got significantly up regulated under high VPD conditions with higher relative expression in the drought susceptible genotype, confirming the suitability of the selected reference genes for expression analysis. This is the first comprehensive study on the stability of the new generation reference genes for qPCR studies in chickpea across species, different tissues and abiotic stresses.

30732163,Weighted gene co-expression network analysis reveals modules and hub genes associated with the development of breast cancer.,"This study aimed to identify modules associated with breast cancer (BC) development by constructing a gene co-expression network, and mining hub genes that may serve as markers of invasive breast cancer (IBC).We downloaded 2 gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to dynamically study the changes of co-expression genes in normal breast tissues, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) tissues, and IBC tissues. Modules that highly correlated with BC development were carried out functional enrichment analysis for annotation, visualization, and integration discovery. The hub genes detected by WGCNA were also confirmed using the Oncomine dataset.We detected 17 transcriptional modules in total and 4 - namely tan, greenyellow, turquoise, and brown - were highly correlated with BC development. The functions of these 4 modules mainly concerned cell migration (tan module, P = 3.03 × 10), the cell cycle (greenyellow module, P = 3.08 × 10), cell-cell adhesion (turquoise module, P = .002), and the extracellular exosome (brown module, P = 1.38 × 10). WGCNA also mined the hub genes, which were highly correlated with the genes in the same module and with BC development. The Oncomine database confirmed that the expressions levels of 6 hub genes were significantly higher in BC tissues than in normal tissues, with fold changes larger than 2 (all P < .05). Apart from the 2 well-known genes EPCAM and MELK, during the development of BC, KRT8, KRT19, KPNA2, and ECT2 also play key roles, and may be used as new targets for the detection or treatment of BC.In summary, our study demonstrated that hub genes such as EPCAM and MELK are highly correlated with breast cancer development.

28527971,Identification and comprehensive evaluation of reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of host gene-expression in Brassica juncea-aphid interaction using microarray data.,"Brassica juncea is a chief oil yielding crop in many parts of the world including India. With advancement of molecular techniques, RT-qPCR based study of gene-expression has become an integral part of experimentations in crop breeding. In RT-qPCR, use of appropriate reference gene(s) is pivotal. The virtue of the reference genes, being constant in expression throughout the experimental treatments, needs to be validated case by case. Appropriate reference gene(s) for normalization of gene-expression data in B. juncea during the biotic stress of aphid infestation is not known. In the present investigation, 11 reference genes identified from microarray database of Arabidopsis-aphid interaction at a cut off FDR ≤0.1, along with two known reference genes of B. juncea, were analyzed for their expression stability upon aphid infestation. These included 6 frequently used and 5 newly identified reference genes. Ranking orders of the reference genes in terms of expression stability were calculated using advanced statistical approaches such as geNorm, NormFinder, delta Ct and BestKeeper. The analysis suggested CAC, TUA and DUF179 as the most suitable reference genes. Further, normalization of the gene-expression data of STP4 and PR1 by the most and the least stable reference gene, respectively has demonstrated importance and applicability of the recommended reference genes in aphid infested samples of B. juncea.",2017-12-29,"Algorithms, Animals, Aphids, Arabidopsis Proteins, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Host-Parasite Interactions, Mustard Plant, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",Plant Physiol Biochem,10.1016/j.plaphy.2017.05.004,Ram

A growing body of evidence suggests that alcohol exposure profoundly impacts a wide range of cytokines and other inflammation-related genes in the CNS. The olfactory system serves as a critical interface between infectious/inflammatory signals and other aspects of CNS function, and demonstrates long-lasting plasticity in response to alcohol exposure. We therefore utilized transcriptome profiling to identify gene expression patterns for immune-related gene families in the olfactory bulb of Long Evans rats. Pregnant dams received either an ad libitum liquid diet containing 35% daily calories from ethanol (ET), a pair-fed diet (PF) matched for caloric content, or free choice (FCL) access to the liquid diet and water from Gestational Day (GD) 11-20. Offspring were fostered to dams fed the FCL diet, weaned on P21, and then housed with same-sex littermates until mid-adolescence (P40) or young adulthood (P90).

26964711,Assessment of reference genes for reliable analysis of gene transcription by RT-qPCR in ovine leukocytes.,"With the availability of genetic sequencing data, quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) is increasingly being used for the quantification of gene transcription across species. Too often there is little regard to the selection of reference genes and the impact that a poor choice has on data interpretation. Indeed, RT-qPCR provides a snapshot of relative gene transcription at a given time-point, and hence is highly dependent on the stability of the transcription of the reference gene(s). Using ovine efferent lymph cells and peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMCs), the two most frequently used leukocytes in immunological studies, we have compared the stability of transcription of the most commonly used ovine reference genes: YWHAZ, RPL-13A, PGK1, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT, SDHA and ACTB. Using established algorithms for reference gene normalization ""geNorm"" and ""Norm Finder"", PGK1, GAPDH and YWHAZ were deemed the most stably transcribed genes for efferent leukocytes and PGK1, YWHAZ and SDHA were optimal in PBMCs. These genes should therefore be considered for accurate and reproducible RT-qPCR data analysis of gene transcription in sheep.

29453432,Validation of house-keeping genes for normalization of gene expression data during diurnal/circadian studies in rice by RT-qPCR.,"The circadian clock in plants is the intrinsic rhythmic expression of thousands of genes in a 24 h period, which is set by the day-night cycles in the environment. The study of the circadian clock often requires expression profiling of genes over a large number of samples for which RT-qPCR is invariably used. Reliability of the results depends largely on the house-keeping genes, which serve as control and thus should be chosen carefully to prevent erroneous results. In this study, ten house-keeping genes were chosen from rice for stability analysis with 48 tissue samples harvested from plants subjected to diurnal/circadian cycles. Although, all the genes were found to be stable, however, six of them showed cyclic expression patterns and caused major changes in the expression profiles of the target genes when used to normalize their expression data, thereby making them poor candidates for diurnal/circadian studies. In conclusion, reference genes need to be selected for diurnal/circadian studies with extra caution as more than 80% of transcriptome in plants undergoes cycling, which remains undetected by the gene stability assessment software and can severely affect the RT-qPCR based gene expression profiling. The geometric mean of two or more most stable reference genes is hence recommended for diurnal/circadian studies in plants.",2019-10-16,"Circadian Clocks, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Essential, Genes, Plant, Oryza, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards",Sci Rep,,Jain

Among the 11 ndh genes, there were frequently large deletions in directly repeated or AT-rich regions. Variation in these degraded ndh genes occurs between individual plants, apparently at population levels in these Cymbidium species. It is likely that ndh gene transfers from the plastome to mitochondrial genome (chondriome) occurred independently in Orchidaceae and that ndh genes in the chondriome were also relatively recently transferred between distantly related species in Orchidaceae. Four variants of the ycf1-rpl32 region, which normally includes the ndhF genes in the plastome, were identified, and some Cymbidium species contained at least two copies of that region in their organellar genomes. The four ycf1-rpl32 variants seem to have a clear pattern of close relationships. Patterns of ndh degradation between closely related taxa and translocation of ndh genes to the chondriome in Cymbidium suggest that there have been multiple bidirectional intracellular gene transfers between two organellar genomes, which have produced different levels of ndh gene degradation among even closely related species.",2017-12-11,"Genes, Plant, Orchidaceae, Phylogeny, Plastids",PLoS One,,Kim

30061686,Genetic regulation of disease risk and endometrial gene expression highlights potential target genes for endometriosis and polycystic ovarian syndrome.,"Gene expression varies markedly across the menstrual cycle and expression levels for many genes are under genetic control. We analyzed gene expression and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in endometrial tissue samples from 229 women and then analyzed the overlap of endometrial eQTL signals with genomic regions associated with endometriosis and other reproductive traits. We observed a total of 45,923 cis-eQTLs for 417 unique genes and 2,968 trans-eQTLs affecting 82 unique genes. Two eQTLs were located in known risk regions for endometriosis including LINC00339 on chromosome 1 and VEZT on chromosome 12 and there was evidence for eQTLs that may be target genes in genomic regions associated with other reproductive diseases. Dynamic changes in expression of individual genes across cycle include alterations in both mean expression and transcriptional silencing. Significant effects of cycle stage on mean expression levels were observed for (2,427/15,262) probes with detectable expression in at least 90% of samples and for (2,877/9,626) probes expressed in some, but not all samples.

I: Inheritance, variability and evolution principles of hydrological genes].","A stochastic hydrological process is influenced by both stochastic and deterministic factors. A hydrological time series contains not only pure random components reflecting its inheri-tance characteristics, but also deterministic components reflecting variability characteristics, such as jump, trend, period, and stochastic dependence. As a result, the stochastic hydrological process presents complicated evolution phenomena and rules. To better understand these complicated phenomena and rules, this study described the inheritance and variability characteristics of an inconsistent hydrological series from two aspects: stochastic process simulation and time series analysis. In addition, several frequency analysis approaches for inconsistent time series were compared to reveal the main problems in inconsistency study. Then, we proposed a new concept of hydrological genes origined from biological genes to describe the inconsistent hydrolocal processes. The hydrologi-cal genes were constructed using moments methods, such as general moments, weight function moments, probability weight moments and L-moments. Meanwhile, the five components, including jump, trend, periodic, dependence and pure random components, of a stochastic hydrological process were defined as five hydrological bases. With this method, the inheritance and variability of inconsistent hydrological time series were synthetically considered and the inheritance, variability and evolution principles were fully described.

28744713,Genome-wide analysis of gene expression profiling revealed that COP9 signalosome is essential for correct expression of Fe homeostasis genes in Arabidopsis.,"In plant cells, either excess or insufficient iron (Fe) concentration triggers stress responses, therefore it is strictly controlled. Proteasome-mediated degradation through ubiquitination of Fe homeostasis proteins has just become the focus of research in recent years. Deactivating ubiquitin ligases, COP9 signalosome has a central importance in the translational control of various stress responses. The aim of the study was to investigate COP9 signalosome in Fe deficiency response of Strategy I plants. In silico analysis of a set of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes was conducted against the transcriptome of Arabidopsis csn mutant lines using Genevestigator software. Induced and suppressed genes were clustered in a hierarchical way and gene ontology enrichment categories were identified. In wild-type Arabidopsis, CSN genes did not respond to iron deficiency. In csn mutant lines, under Fe-sufficient conditions, hundreds of Fe-deficiency-responsive genes were misregulated. Among the ones previously characterized for their physiological roles under Fe deficiency IRT1, NAS4, BTS, NRAMP1 were down-regulated while AHA2, MTP8, FRD3 were up-regulated. Unexpectedly, from those which were regulated in opposite ways, some had been repeatedly shown to be tightly co-regulated by the same transcription factor, FIT. Two proteins from DELLA family, which were reported to interact with FIT to repress its downstream, were found to be strikingly repressed in csn mutants. Overall, the study underlined that the absence of a functional CSN greatly impacted the regulation of Fe homeostasis-related genes, in a manner which cannot be explained simply by the induction of the master transcription factor, FIT.

27560664,Validation of Reference Genes for Robust qRT-PCR Gene Expression Analysis in the Rice Blast Fungus Magnaporthe oryzae.,"The rice blast fungus causes significant annual harvest losses. It also serves as a genetically-tractable model to study fungal ingress. Whilst pathogenicity determinants have been unmasked and changes in global gene expression described, we know little about Magnaporthe oryzae cell wall remodelling. Our interests, in wall remodelling genes expressed during infection, vegetative growth and under exogenous wall stress, demand robust choice of reference genes for quantitative Real Time-PCR (qRT-PCR) data normalisation. We describe the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes profiled by qRT-PCR with cDNAs derived during asexual germling development, from sexual stage perithecia and from vegetative mycelium grown under various exogenous stressors. Our Minimum Information for Publication of qRT-PCR Experiments (MIQE) compliant analysis reveals a set of robust reference genes used to track changes in the expression of the cell wall remodelling gene MGG_Crh2 (MGG_00592). We ranked nine candidate reference genes by their expression stability (M) and report the best gene combination needed for reliable gene expression normalisation, when assayed in three tissue groups (Infective, Vegetative, and Global) frequently used in M. oryzae expression studies. We found that MGG_Actin (MGG_03982) and the 40S 27a ribosomal subunit MGG_40s (MGG_02872) proved to be robust reference genes for the Infection group and MGG_40s and MGG_Ef1 (Elongation Factor1-α) for both Vegetative and Global groups. Using the above validated reference genes, M. oryzae MGG_Crh2 expression was found to be significantly (p<0.05) elevated three-fold during vegetative growth as compared with dormant spores and two fold higher under cell wall stress (Congo Red) compared to growth under optimal conditions. We recommend the combinatorial use of two reference genes, belonging to the cytoskeleton and ribosomal synthesis functional groups, MGG_Actin, MGG_40s, MGG_S8 (Ribosomal subunit 40S S8) or MGG_Ef1, which demonstrated low M values across heterogeneous tissues. By contrast, metabolic pathway genes MGG_Fad (FAD binding domain-containing protein) and MGG_Gapdh (Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) performed poorly, due to their lack of expression stability across samples.

28453515,Reliable reference genes for normalization of gene expression data in tea plants (Camellia sinensis) exposed to metal stresses.,"Tea plants [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze] are an important leaf-type crop that are widely used for the production of non-alcoholic beverages in the world. Exposure to excessive amounts of heavy metals adversely affects the quality and yield of tea leaves. To analyze the molecular responses of tea plants to heavy metals, a reliable quantification of gene expression is important and of major importance herein is the normalization of the measured expression levels for the target genes. Ideally, stably expressed reference genes should be evaluated in all experimental systems. In this study, 12 candidate reference genes (i.e., 18S rRNA, Actin, CYP, EF-1α, eIF-4α, GAPDH, MON1, PP2AA3, TBP, TIP41, TUA, and UBC) were cloned from tea plants, and the stability of their expression was examined systematically in 60 samples exposed to diverse heavy metals (i.e., manganese, aluminum, copper, iron, and zinc). Three Excel-based algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to evaluate the expression stability of these genes. PP2AA3 and 18S rRNA were the most stably expressed genes, even though their expression profiles exhibited some variability. Moreover, commonly used reference genes (i.e., GAPDH and TBP) were the least appropriate reference genes for most samples. To further validate the suitability of the analyzed reference genes, the expression level of a phytochelatin synthase gene (i.e., CsPCS1) was determined using the putative reference genes for data normalizations.

26192306,Identification of Suitable Reference Genes for Investigating Gene Expression in Anterior Cruciate Ligament Injury by Using Reverse Transcription-Quantitative PCR.,"The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is one of the most frequently injured structures during high-impact sporting activities. Gene expression analysis may be a useful tool for understanding ACL tears and healing failure. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has emerged as an effective method for such studies. However, this technique requires the use of suitable reference genes for data normalization. Here, we evaluated the suitability of six reference genes (18S, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, HPRT1, and TBP) by using ACL samples of 39 individuals with ACL tears (20 with isolated ACL tears and 19 with ACL tear and combined meniscal injury) and of 13 controls. The stability of the candidate reference genes was determined by using the NormFinder, geNorm, BestKeeper DataAssist, and RefFinder software packages and the comparative ΔCt method. ACTB was the best single reference gene and ACTB+TBP was the best gene pair. The GenEx software showed that the accumulated standard deviation is reduced when a larger number of reference genes is used for gene expression normalization. However, the use of a single reference gene may not be suitable. To identify the optimal combination of reference genes, we evaluated the expression of FN1 and PLOD1. We observed that at least 3 reference genes should be used. ACTB+HPRT1+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving isolated ACL tears and controls. Conversely, ACTB+TBP+18S is the best trio for the analyses involving (1) injured ACL tears and controls, and (2) ACL tears of patients with meniscal tears and controls. Therefore, if the gene expression study aims to compare non-injured ACL, isolated ACL tears and ACL tears from patients with meniscal tear as three independent groups ACTB+TBP+18S+HPRT1 should be used. In conclusion, 3 or more genes should be used as reference genes for analysis of ACL samples of individuals with and without ACL tears.

25945879,Tumor suppressor genes are larger than apoptosis-effector genes and have more regions of active chromatin: Connection to a stochastic paradigm for sequential gene expression programs.,"Apoptosis- and proliferation-effector genes are substantially regulated by the same transactivators, with E2F-1 and Oct-1 being notable examples. The larger proliferation-effector genes have more binding sites for the transactivators that regulate both sets of genes, and proliferation-effector genes have more regions of active chromatin, i.e, DNase I hypersensitive and histone 3, lysine-4 trimethylation sites. Thus, the size differences between the 2 classes of genes suggest a transcriptional regulation paradigm whereby the accumulation of transcription factors that regulate both sets of genes, merely as an aspect of stochastic behavior, accumulate first on the larger proliferation-effector gene ""traps,"" and then accumulate on the apoptosis effector genes, thereby effecting sequential activation of the 2 different gene sets. As IRF-1 and p53 levels increase, tumor suppressor proteins are first activated, followed by the activation of apoptosis-effector genes, for example during S-phase pausing for DNA repair. Tumor suppressor genes are larger than apoptosis-effector genes and have more IRF-1 and p53 binding sites, thereby likewise suggesting a paradigm for transcription sequencing based on stochastic interactions of transcription factors with different gene classes. In this report, using the ENCODE database, we determined that tumor suppressor genes have a greater number of open chromatin regions and histone 3 lysine-4 trimethylation sites, consistent with the idea that a larger gene size can facilitate earlier transcriptional activation via the inclusion of more transactivator binding sites.

27522520,Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-mediated functional characterization of two genes involved in lignocellulosic secondary cell wall formation.,"Functional characterization of two tobacco genes, one involved in xylan synthesis and the other, a positive regulator of secondary cell wall formation, is reported. Lignocellulosic secondary cell walls (SCW) provide essential plant materials for the production of second-generation bioethanol. Therefore, thorough understanding of the process of SCW formation in plants is beneficial for efficient bioethanol production. Recently, we provided the first proof-of-concept for using virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach for rapid functional characterization of nine genes involved in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin synthesis during SCW formation. Here, we report VIGS-mediated functional characterization of two tobacco genes involved in SCW formation. Stems of VIGS plants silenced for both selected genes showed increased amount of xylem formation but thinner cell walls than controls. These results were further confirmed by production of stable transgenic tobacco plants manipulated in expression of these genes. Stems of stable transgenic tobacco plants silenced for these two genes showed increased xylem proliferation with thinner walls, whereas transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing these two genes showed increased fiber cell wall thickness but no change in xylem proliferation. These two selected genes were later identified as possible members of DUF579 family involved in xylan synthesis and KNAT7 transcription factor family involved in positive regulation of SCW formation, respectively. Glycome analyses of cell walls showed increased polysaccharide extractability in 1 M KOH extracts of both VIGS-NbDUF579 and VIGS-NbKNAT7 lines suggestive of cell wall loosening. Also, VIGS-NbDUF579 and VIGS-NbKNAT7 lines showed increased saccharification rates (74.5 and 40 % higher than controls, respectively).

Then, a set of genes involved in different steps of carotenogenesis was identified and those coding for phytoene desaturase, phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase and carotenoid dioxygenase (CAR genes) proved to be clustered within a region of ~10 kb. Quantitative PCR of the genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis showed that genes coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-CoA reductase and mevalonate kinase are induced during exponential phase while no clear trend of induction was observed for phytoene synthase/lycopene cyclase and phytoene dehydrogenase encoding genes. Thus, in R. mucilaginosa the induction of genes involved in the early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis is transient and accompanies the onset of carotenoid production, while that of CAR genes does not correlate with the amount of carotenoids produced. The transcript levels of genes coding for carotenoid dioxygenase, superoxide dismutase and catalase A increased during the accumulation of carotenoids, thus suggesting the activation of a mechanism aimed at the protection of cell structures from oxidative stress during carotenoid biosynthesis. The data presented herein, besides being suitable for the elucidation of the mechanisms that underlie carotenoid biosynthesis, will contribute to boosting the biotechnological potential of this yeast by improving the outcome of further research efforts aimed at also exploring other features of interest.",2018-11-20,"Biosynthetic Pathways, Carotenoids, Enzyme Activation, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Genes, Fungal, Genome, Fungal, Kinetics, Multigene Family, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Rhodotorula, Transcription, Genetic",Microbiology,10.1099/mic.0.000588,Landolfo

29186889,A Strategy for Identifying Quantitative Trait Genes Using Gene Expression Analysis and Causal Analysis.,"Large numbers of quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting complex diseases and other quantitative traits have been reported in humans and model animals. However, the genetic architecture of these traits remains elusive due to the difficulty in identifying causal quantitative trait genes (QTGs) for common QTL with relatively small phenotypic effects. A traditional strategy based on techniques such as positional cloning does not always enable identification of a single candidate gene for a QTL of interest because it is difficult to narrow down a target genomic interval of the QTL to a very small interval harboring only one gene. A combination of gene expression analysis and statistical causal analysis can greatly reduce the number of candidate genes. This integrated approach provides causal evidence that one of the candidate genes is a putative QTG for the QTL. Using this approach, I have recently succeeded in identifying a single putative QTG for resistance to obesity in mice. Here, I outline the integration approach and discuss its usefulness using my studies as an example.",,,Genes (Basel),,Ishikawa

The aim was to identify abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)-associated microRNAs and their target genes in AAA using microarray analysis. What is the main finding and its importance? The main finding was that miR-145 and miR-30c-2* were found to be downregulated microRNAs in AAA, which could exert suppressive effects on AAA progression, and that miR-145 might target RAC2, whereas miR-30c-2* might target PIK3CD, IL1B and RAC2.

32391043,"Cotton Duplicated Genes Produced by Polyploidy Show Significantly Elevated and Unbalanced Evolutionary Rates, Overwhelmingly Perturbing Gene Tree Topology.","A phylogenetic tree can be used to illustrate the evolutionary relationship between a group of genes, especially duplicated genes, which are sources of genetic innovation and are often a hotspot of research. However, duplicated genes may have complex phylogenetic topologies due to changes in their evolutionary rates. Here, by constructing phylogenetic trees using different methods, we evaluated the phylogenetic relationships of duplicated genes produced by polyploidization in cotton. We found that at least 83.2% of phylogenetic trees did not conform the expected topology. Moreover, cotton homologous gene copy number has little effect on the topology of duplicated genes. Compared with their cacao orthologs, elevated evolutionary rates of cotton genes are responsible for distorted tree topology. Furthermore, as to both branch and site models, we inferred that positive natural selection during the divergence of fiber-development-related MYB genes was likely, and found that the reconstructed tree topology may often overestimate natural selection, as compared to the inference with the expected trees. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of borrowing precious information from gene collinearity in tree construction and evaluation, and have evidence to alert the citation of thousands of previous reports of adaptivity and functional innovation of duplicated genes.",,,Front Genet,,Meng

However, it has two limitations: first, the geometric structure hidden in data, e.g., pair-wise distance between data points, have not been explored. This information can facilitate sample clustering; second, the Principal Components (PCs) determined by PCA are dense, leading to hard interpretation. However, only a few of genes are related to the cancer.

31142023,Analysis of miRNAs Targeted Storage Regulatory Genes during Soybean Seed Development Based on Transcriptome Sequencing.,"Soybeans are an important cash crop and are widely used as a source of vegetable protein and edible oil. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous small RNA that play an important regulatory role in the evolutionarily conserved system of gene expression. In this study, we selected four lines with extreme phenotypes, as well as high or low protein and oil content, from the chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) constructed from suinong (SN14) and ZYD00006, and planted and sampled at three stages of grain development for small RNA sequencing and expression analysis. The sequencing results revealed the expression pattern of miRNA in the materials, and predicted miRNA-targeted regulatory genes, including 1967 pairs of corresponding relationships between known-miRNA and their target genes, as well as 597 pairs of corresponding relationships between novel-miRNA and their target genes. After screening and annotating genes that were targeted for regulation, five specific genes were identified to be differentially expressed during seed development and subsequently analyzed for their regulatory relationship with miRNAs. The expression pattern of the targeted gene was verified by Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our research provides more information about the miRNA regulatory network in soybeans and further identifies useful genes that regulate storage during soy grain development, providing a theoretical basis for the regulation of soybean quality traits.",2019-12-26,"Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Regulator, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, MicroRNAs, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Plant Development, Seed Storage Proteins, Seeds, Soybeans, Transcriptome, Whole Exome Sequencing",Genes (Basel),,Yu
29236756,Stability evaluation of reference genes for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR in soybean under different conditions.,"Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR is a sensitive and widely used technique to quantify gene expression. To achieve a reliable result, appropriate reference genes are highly required for normalization of transcripts in different samples. In this study, 9 previously published reference genes (60S, Fbox, ELF1A, ELF1B, ACT11, TUA5, UBC4, G6PD, CYP2) of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] were selected. The expression stability of the 9 genes was evaluated under conditions of biotic stress caused by infection with soybean mosaic virus, nitrogen stress, across different cultivars and developmental stages. ΔCt and geNorm algorithms were used to evaluate and rank the expression stability of the 9 reference genes. Results obtained from two algorithms showed high consistency. Moreover, results of pairwise variation showed that two reference genes were sufficient to normalize the expression levels of target genes under each experimental setting. For virus infection, ELF1A and ELF1B were the most stable reference genes for accurate normalization. For different developmental stages, Fbox and G6PD had the highest expression stability between two soybean cultivars (Tanlong No. 1 and Tanlong No. 2). ELF1B and ACT11 were identified as the most stably expressed reference genes both under nitrogen stress and among different cultivars. The results showed that none of the candidate reference genes were uniformly expressed at different conditions, and selecting appropriate reference genes was pivotal for gene expression studies with particular condition and tissue. The most stable combination of genes identified in this study will help to achieve more accurate and reliable results in a wide variety of samples in soybean.",2018-01-04,"Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Plant, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Soybeans",PLoS One,,Wan

Heat stress, which is one of the most important environmental abiotic stresses, seriously affects the growth, development, and yield of microorganisms. Understanding the response to heat stress has gradually become a hotspot in microorganism research. But suitable reference genes for expression analysis under heat stress have not been reported in G. lucidum. In this study, we systematically identified 11 candidate reference genes that were measured using reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the gene expression stability was analyzed under heat stress conditions using geNorm and NormFinder. The results show that 5 reference genes-CYP and TIF, followed by UCE2, ACTIN, and UBQ1-are the most stable genes under our experimental conditions. Moreover, the relative expression levels of 3 heat stress response genes (hsp17.4, hsp70, and hsp90) were analyzed under heat stress conditions with different normalization strategies.

31525193,"Dosage regulation, and variation in gene expression and copy number of human Y chromosome ampliconic genes.","The Y chromosome harbors nine multi-copy ampliconic gene families expressed exclusively in testis. The gene copies within each family are >99% identical to each other, which poses a major challenge in evaluating their copy number. Recent studies demonstrated high variation in Y ampliconic gene copy number among humans. However, how this variation affects expression levels in human testis remains understudied. Here we developed a novel computational tool Ampliconic Copy Number Estimator (AmpliCoNE) that utilizes read sequencing depth information to estimate Y ampliconic gene copy number per family. We applied this tool to whole-genome sequencing data of 149 men with matched testis expression data whose samples are part of the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We found that the Y ampliconic gene families with low copy number in humans were deleted or pseudogenized in non-human great apes, suggesting relaxation of functional constraints. Among the Y ampliconic gene families, higher copy number leads to higher expression. Within the Y ampliconic gene families, copy number does not influence gene expression, rather a high tolerance for variation in gene expression was observed in testis of presumably healthy men. No differences in gene expression levels were found among major Y haplogroups. Age positively correlated with expression levels of the HSFY and PRY gene families in the African subhaplogroup E1b, but not in the European subhaplogroups R1b and I1. We also found that expression of five Y ampliconic gene families is coordinated with that of their non-Y (i.e. X or autosomal) homologs. Indeed, five ampliconic gene families had consistently lower expression levels when compared to their non-Y homologs suggesting dosage regulation, while the HSFY family had higher expression levels than its X homolog and thus lacked dosage regulation.",2020-02-20,"Animals, Chromosomes, Human, Y, DNA Copy Number Variations, Databases, Genetic, Dosage Compensation, Genetic, Epigenesis, Genetic, Gene Dosage, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Y-Linked, Heat Shock Transcription Factors, Humans, Male, Multigene Family, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Testis",PLoS Genet,,Vegesna

To better understand the scope and function of tr gene family in common carp, one of the most economic and important breeding fish species, which has undergone an additional round of whole genome duplication (WGD), we characterized 13 tr gene homologues including eight type I and five type II taste receptor genes from common carp genome, which were more than any other teleosts. Phylogenetic and syntenic analysis revealed the evolution dynamics of tr gene family, which was highly conserved, though gene duplication and gene loss do exist recently. Furthermore, the motif and dN/dS analyses indicated that these receptors were under different negative selection pressure. Additionally, the gene expression divergences were observed in 12 health tissues of common carp, with a relatively high level in barbel and head kidney, demonstrating tissue-specific expression of tr genes in the tetraploidized genome. The overarching goals of this study were to identify the abundance of tr genes in common carp, compare the gene divergence among species with varied feeding habits and provide genomic resources for future studies on teleost taste sensation.",2018-10-22,"Animals, Carps, Evolution, Molecular, Fish Proteins, Gene Expression, Head Kidney, Multigene Family, Organ Specificity, Phylogeny, Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled, Tetraploidy, Tissue Distribution",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.07.078,Kong
27900493,Mining the Cicer arietinum genome for the mildew locus O (Mlo) gene family and comparative evolutionary analysis of the Mlo genes from Medicago truncatula and some other plant species.,"The mildew locus O (Mlo) gene family is ubiquitous in land plants. Some members of this gene family are involved in negative regulation of powdery mildew resistance, while others are involved in several other biological functions. Mlo proteins have characteristic seven transmembrane domains and a calmodulin-binding domain at their C-termini, and are associated with plasma membrane. The Mlo gene family has been studied in several economically important cereals, but little information is available on this gene family in the important legumes, Medicago truncatula Gaertn. and Cicer arietinum L. We carried out a comprehensive and comparative investigation of the Mlo gene family in these two species using the genome sequences available at the M. truncatula genome database (Mt v4.0) and NCBI (C. arietinum). A genome-wide homology-based search using Arabidopsis Mlo proteins as query identified 16 MtMlo (M. truncatula Mlo) and 14 CarMlo (C. arietinum Mlo) genes. The MtMlo and CarMlo genes had comparable gene structure, protein sequence and topology. Their chromosomal locations indicated the occurrence of extensive reorganization in the genomes of the two species after their divergence from the common ancestor. A multiple sequence alignment of 53 Mlo proteins from these two and several other species showed a highly conserved sequence block of seven amino acids, viz., L-ETPTW, towards their N-termini. The evolutionary phylogenetic analysis grouped the MtMlo and CarMlo members into four clusters, and most of the MtMlo and CarMlo members formed one-to-one ortholog pairs.

P. massoniana CPG has a typical quadripartite structure that includes large single copy (LSC) (65,563 bp), small single copy (SSC) (53,230 bp) and two IRs (IRa and IRb, 485 bp). The 108 unique genes were identified, including 73 protein-coding genes, 31 tRNAs, and 4 rRNAs. Most of the 81 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified in CPG were mononucleotides motifs of A/T types and located in non-coding regions. Comparisons with related species revealed an inversion (21,556 bp) in the LSC region; P. massoniana CPG lacks all 11 intact ndh genes (four ndh genes lost completely; the five remained truncated as pseudogenes; and the other two ndh genes remain as pseudogenes because of short insertions or deletions). A pair of short IRs was found instead of large IRs, and size variations among pine species were observed, which resulted from short insertions or deletions and non-synchronized variations between ""IRa"" and ""IRb"".

29765375,"Functional Alleles of Chicken BG Genes, Members of the Butyrophilin Gene Family, in Peripheral T Cells.","γδ T cells recognize a wide variety of ligands in mammals, among them members of the butyrophilin (BTN) family. Nothing is known about γδ T cell ligands in chickens, despite there being many such cells in blood and lymphoid tissues, as well as in mucosal surfaces. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of chickens was discovered because of polymorphic BG genes, part of the BTN family. All but two BG genes are located in the BG region, oriented head-to-tail so that unequal crossing-over has led to copy number variation (CNV) as well as hybrid (chimeric) genes, making it difficult to identify true alleles. One approach is to examine BG genes expressed in particular cell types, which likely have the same functions in different BG haplotypes and thus can be considered ""functional alleles."" We cloned nearly full-length BG transcripts from peripheral T cells of four haplotypes (B2, B15, B19, and B21), and compared them to the BG genes of the B12 haplotype that previously were studied in detail. A dominant BG gene was found in each haplotype, but with significant levels of subdominant transcripts in three haplotypes (B2, B15, and B19). For three haplotypes (B15, B19, and B21), most sequences are closely-related to BG8, BG9, and BG12 from the B12 haplotype. We found that variation in the extracellular immunoglobulin-variable-like (Ig-V) domain is mostly localized to the membrane distal loops but without evidence for selection. However, variation in the cytoplasmic tail composed of many amino acid heptad repeats does appear to be selected (although not obviously localized), consistent with an intriguing clustering of charged and polar residues in an apparent α-helical coiled-coil. By contrast, the dominantly-expressed BG gene in the B2 haplotype is identical to BG13 from the B12 haplotype, and most of the subdominant sequences are from the BG5-BG7-BG11 clade. Moreover, alternative splicing leading to intron read-through results in dramatically truncated cytoplasmic tails, particularly for the dominantly-expressed BG gene of the B2 haplotype.

They contain high amounts of cellulose and so are used for linen textiles and in the composite industry. In this study, we screened the annotated flax genome and identified 14 distinct cellulose synthase (CESA) genes using orthologous sequences previously identified. Transcriptomics of 'primary cell wall' and 'secondary cell wall' flax CESA genes showed that some were preferentially expressed in different organs and stem tissues providing clues as to their biological role(s) in planta. The development for the first time in flax of a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach was used to functionally evaluate the biological role of different CESA genes in stem tissues. Quantification of transcript accumulation showed that in many cases, silencing not only affected targeted CESA clades, but also had an impact on other CESA genes. Whatever the targeted clade, inactivation by VIGS affected plant growth. In contrast, only clade 1- and clade 6-targeted plants showed modifications in outer-stem tissue organization and secondary cell wall formation. In these plants, bast fibre number and structure were severely impacted, suggesting that the targeted genes may play an important role in the establishment of the fibre cell wall.

Our previous study has shown that more rice blast R-genes can be cloned in rapidly evolving NBS-LRR gene families. In the present study, two rapidly evolving R-gene families in rice were selected for cloning a subset of genes from their paralogs in three resistant rice lines. A total of eight functional blast R-genes were identified among nine NBS-LRR genes, and some of these showed resistance to three or more blast strains. Evolutionary analysis indicated that high nucleotide diversity of coding regions served as important parameters in the determination of gene resistance. We also observed that amino-acid variants (nonsynonymous mutations, insertions, or deletions) in essential motifs of the NBS domain contribute to the blast resistance capacity of NBS-LRR genes. These results suggested that the NBS regions might also play an important role in resistance specificity determination. On the other hand, different splicing patterns of introns were commonly observed in R-genes. The results of the present study contribute to improving the effectiveness of R-gene identification by using evolutionary analysis method and acquisition of novel blast resistance genes.

The identification of genes related to disease resistance and the underlying mechanisms will contribute to improving disease resistance via sweet potato breeding programs. In the present study, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling of sweet potato challenged with Fob using Illumina HiSeq technology. In total, 89,944,188 clean reads were generated from 12 samples and assembled into 101,988 unigenes with an average length of 666 bp; of these unigenes, 62,605 (61.38%) were functionally annotated in the NCBI non-redundant protein database by BLASTX with a cutoff E-value of 10-5. Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotations were examined to explore the unigenes' functions. We constructed four DGE libraries for the sweet potato cultivars JinShan57 (JS57, highly resistant) and XinZhongHua (XZH, highly susceptible), which were challenged with pathogenic Fob. Genes that were differentially expressed in the four libraries were identified by comparing the transcriptomes. Various genes that were differentially expressed during defense, including chitin elicitor receptor kinase 1 (CERK), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), WRKY, NAC, MYB, and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF), as well as resistance genes, pathogenesis-related genes, and genes involved in salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathways, were identified.

Reference genes, which are often referred to as housekeeping genes, such as GAPDH, G3PDH, EF2, RpL7A, RpL10, TUBα and Actin, have traditionally been assumed to be stably expressed in all conditions, and they are frequently used to normalize mRNA levels between different samples in qPCR analysis. However, it is known that the expression of these genes is influenced by numerous factors, such as experimental conditions. The difference in gene expression underlies a range of biological processes, including development, reproduction and behavior. The aim of this study was to show the problems associated with using reference genes in the qPCR technique, in a study on inbred strains of Spodoptera exigua selected toward cadmium resistance. We present and discuss our results and observations, and give some recommendations concerning the use and limitations of housekeeping genes as internal standards, especially in research on insects.

31223620,Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Normalization in RAW264.7 Cells under Different Conditions.,"RAW264.7 is a macrophage strain derived from mice tumour and shows a significant ability in antigen uptake. Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is one of the most commonly used methods in gene studies and requires suitable reference genes to normalize and quantitate the expression of gene of interest with sensitivity and specificity. However, suitable reference genes in RAW264.7 cells have not yet been identified for accurate gene expression quantification. In the current study, we evaluated expression levels of ten candidate reference genes in RAW264.7 cells under different conditions. RT-qPCR results indicated significant differences in the expression levels among the ten reference genes. Statistical analyses were carried out using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper software to further investigate the stability of the reference genes. Integrating the results from the three analytical methods, cytochrome c-1 and hydroxymethylbilane synthase were found to be the most stable and therefore more suitable reference genes, while ribosomal protein L4 and cyclophilin A were the least stable. This study emphasises the importance of identifying and selecting the most stable reference genes for normalization and provides a basis for future gene expression studies using RAW264.7 cells.",2019-12-06,"Algorithms, Animals, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Mice, RAW 264.7 Cells, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Software",Biomed Res Int,,Bao
30692607,Prioritizing Crohn's disease genes by integrating association signals with gene expression implicates monocyte subsets.,"Genome-wide association studies have identified ~170 loci associated with Crohn's disease (CD) and defining which genes drive these association signals is a major challenge. The primary aim of this study was to define which CD locus genes are most likely to be disease related. We developed a gene prioritization regression model (GPRM) by integrating complementary mRNA expression datasets, including bulk RNA-Seq from the terminal ileum of 302 newly diagnosed, untreated CD patients and controls, and in stimulated monocytes. Transcriptome-wide association and co-expression network analyses were performed on the ileal RNA-Seq datasets, identifying 40 genome-wide significant genes. Co-expression network analysis identified a single gene module, which was substantially enriched for CD locus genes and most highly expressed in monocytes. By including expression-based and epigenetic information, we refined likely CD genes to 2.5 prioritized genes per locus from an average of 7.8 total genes. We validated our model structure using cross-validation and our prioritization results by protein-association network analyses, which demonstrated significantly higher CD gene interactions for prioritized compared with non-prioritized genes. Although individual datasets cannot convey all of the information relevant to a disease, combining data from multiple relevant expression-based datasets improves prediction of disease genes and helps to further understanding of disease pathogenesis.",2020-01-27,"Adolescent, Algorithms, Case-Control Studies, Child, Child, Preschool, Crohn Disease, Female, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Male, Monocytes, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Software, Transcriptome",Genes Immun,,Gettler

The expression profile GSE 16515 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which included 36 PC tissue samples and 16 normal samples. Limma package in R language was used to screen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were grouped as up‑ and downregulated genes. Then, PFSNet was applied to perform subnetwork analysis for all the DEGs. Moreover, Gene Ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis of up‑ and downregulated genes was performed, followed by protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network construction using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes. In total, 1,989 DEGs including 1,461 up‑ and 528 downregulated genes were screened out. Subnetworks including pancreatic cancer in PC tissue samples and intercellular adhesion in normal samples were identified, respectively. A total of 8 significant REACTOME pathways for upregulated DEGs, such as hemostasis and cell cycle, mitotic were identified. Moreover, 4 significant REACTOME pathways for downregulated DEGs, including regulation of β‑cell development and transmembrane transport of small molecules were screened out. Additionally, DEGs with high connectivity degrees, such as CCNA2 (cyclin A2) and PBK (PDZ binding kinase), of the module in the protein‑protein interaction network were mainly enriched with cell‑division cycle. CCNA2 and PBK of the module and their relative pathway cell‑division cycle, and two subnetworks (pancreatic cancer and intercellular adhesion subnetworks) may be pivotal for further understanding of the molecular mechanism of PC.

During the process of vernalization and flower bud differentiation, sugar massively accumulated in the bulb, which influenced the bulb development. However, the details of sugar genes' regulation mechanism for these processes were not fully understood. Here, morphological physiology, transcriptomes and gene engineering technology were used to explore this physiological change. Seventy-two genes of 25 kinds of sugar metabolism-related genes were annotated after re-analyzing transcriptome data of Oriental hybrid lily 'Sorbonne' bulbs, which were generated on Hiseq Illumina 2000. The results showed that these genes were closely related to lily bulb vernalization and development. Combining gene expression pattern with gene co-expression network, five genes (Contig5669, Contig13319, Contig7715, Contig1420 and Contig87292) were considered to be the most potential signals, and the sucrose transporter gene (",,,Int J Mol Sci,,Gu

28835591,Rasd1 is an estrogen-responsive immediate early gene and modulates expression of late genes in rat anterior pituitary cells.,"Dexamethasone-induced Ras-related protein 1 (Rasd1) is a member of the Ras superfamily of monomeric G proteins that have a regulatory function in signal transduction. Here we investigated the role of Rasd1 in regulating estrogen-induced gene expression in primary cultures of rat anterior pituitary cells. Rasd1 mRNA expression in anterior pituitary cells decreased after treatment with forskolin or serum and increased after treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2). Increases in Rasd1 mRNA expression occurred as early as 0.5 h after E2 treatment, peaked at 1 h and were sustained for as long as 96 h. This rapid and profound increase in Rasd1 mRNA expression induced by E2 was also seen in GH4C1 cells, an estrogen receptor-positive somatolactotroph cell line. Among pituitary estrogen-responsive late genes studied, basal mRNA expression of Pim3 and Igf1 genes was decreased by RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Rasd1 expression, whereas basal expression of the Giot1 gene was increased. Moreover, Rasd1 knockdown enhanced stimulation of Pim3 mRNA expression and attenuated inhibition of Fosl1 mRNA expression 24 h after E2 treatment. These changes in mRNA expression were accompanied by enhanced activity of promoters containing CRE, AP-1 and SRE binding sequences. These results suggest that Rasd1 is an estrogen-responsive immediate early gene and modulates E2 induction of at least several late genes in anterior pituitary cells.",2018-07-27,"Animals, Cells, Cultured, Estradiol, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Immediate-Early, Pituitary Hormones, Anterior, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Signal Transduction, Transcription, Genetic, ras Proteins",Endocr J,10.1507/endocrj.EJ17-0148,Wang

25809293,Virus-induced gene silencing of Withania somnifera squalene synthase negatively regulates sterol and defence-related genes resulting in reduced withanolides and biotic stress tolerance.,"Withania somnifera (L.) Dunal is an important Indian medicinal plant that produces withanolides, which are triterpenoid steroidal lactones having diverse biological activities. To enable fast and efficient functional characterization of genes in this slow-growing and difficult-to-transform plant, a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was established by silencing phytoene desaturase (PDS) and squalene synthase (SQS). VIGS of the gene encoding SQS, which provides precursors for triterpenoids, resulted in significant reduction of squalene and withanolides, demonstrating its application in studying withanolides biosynthesis in W. somnifera leaves. A comprehensive analysis of gene expression and sterol pathway intermediates in WsSQS-vigs plants revealed transcriptional modulation with positive feedback regulation of mevalonate pathway genes, and negative feed-forward regulation of downstream sterol pathway genes including DWF1 (delta-24-sterol reductase) and CYP710A1 (C-22-sterol desaturase), resulting in significant reduction of sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol. However, there was little effect of SQS silencing on cholesterol, indicating the contribution of sitosterol, campesterol and stigmasterol, but not of cholesterol, towards withanolides formation. Branch-point oxidosqualene synthases in WsSQS-vigs plants exhibited differential regulation with reduced CAS (cycloartenol synthase) and cycloartenol, and induced BAS (β-amyrin synthase) and β-amyrin. Moreover, SQS silencing also led to the down-regulation of brassinosteroid-6-oxidase-2 (BR6OX2), pathogenesis-related (PR) and nonexpressor of PR (NPR) genes, resulting in reduced tolerance to bacterial and fungal infection as well as to insect feeding. Taken together, SQS silencing negatively regulated sterol and defence-related genes leading to reduced phytosterols, withanolides and biotic stress tolerance, thus implicating the application of VIGS for functional analysis of genes related to withanolides formation in W. somnifera leaves.",2016-11-07,"Farnesyl-Diphosphate Farnesyltransferase, Gene Silencing, Genes, Plant, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Oxidoreductases, Plant Leaves, Stress, Physiological, Withania, Withanolides",Plant Biotechnol J,10.1111/pbi.12347,Singh
25849964,Evaluation and validation of housekeeping genes as reference for gene expression studies in pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) under drought stress conditions.,"Gene expression analysis using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a very sensitive technique and its sensitivity depends on the stable performance of reference gene(s) used in the study. A number of housekeeping genes have been used in various expression studies in many crops however, their expression were found to be inconsistent under different stress conditions. As a result, species specific housekeeping genes have been recommended for different expression studies in several crop species. However, such specific housekeeping genes have not been reported in the case of pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) despite the fact that genome sequence has become available for the crop. To identify the stable housekeeping genes in pigeonpea for expression analysis under drought stress conditions, the relative expression variations of 10 commonly used housekeeping genes (EF1α, UBQ10, GAPDH, 18SrRNA, 25SrRNA, TUB6, ACT1, IF4α, UBC and HSP90) were studied on root, stem and leaves tissues of Asha (ICPL 87119). Three statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper were used to define the stability of candidate genes. geNorm analysis identified IF4α and TUB6 as the most stable housekeeping genes however, NormFinder analysis determined IF4α and HSP90 as the most stable housekeeping genes under drought stress conditions. Subsequently validation of the identified candidate genes was undertaken in qRT-PCR based gene expression analysis of uspA gene which plays an important role for drought stress conditions in pigeonpea. The relative quantification of the uspA gene varied according to the internal controls (stable and least stable genes), thus highlighting the importance of the choice of as well as validation of internal controls in such experiments. The identified stable and validated housekeeping genes will facilitate gene expression studies in pigeonpea especially under drought stress conditions.

Analogous to this is comparing gene expression across species, which can improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the evolution of both individual genes and functional pathways. One area of interest is determining genes showing signals of coevolution, which can also indicate potential functional similarity, analogous to co-expression analysis often performed across conditions for a single species.

A prioritized set of 92 SNPs that belong to important reproductive and metabolic pathway genes were genotyped on 250 PCOS cases and 299 ethnically matched controls, representing the southern Indian population of Hyderabad, using SEQUENOM MassARRAY iPLEX™ platform. These data were analyzed both for individual SNP association patterns as well as for gene-gene interactions, besides obtaining cumulative risk score and the ROC curve with the help of appropriate statistical packages such as PLINK, SNPAssoc of R-program, Haploview, GMDR and SPSS. The analysis of 72 of the 92 SNPs, after excluding 20 of those that showed either minor allele frequency < 1% and/or deviated from Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p < .001), suggested that only 13 were associated with PCOS at p ≤ .05, but none after correction for multiple testing. Further, neither any of the diabetic genes nor the interactions between diabetic and reproductive pathway genes were found to be significant even at p ≤ .05.The lack of association of any of the SNPs with PCOS and/or the gene-gene interactions among them may be because of the minor effects of each of them on the phenotype(OR < 2). Further, that none of the type 2 diabetes genes were associated with PCOS in the present study as well as in the earlier studies from different ethnic groups may indicate probable universality of this pattern. It is possible that there are still other genetic variants, novel as well as already known, which may confer greater risk than the ones considered in this study and further studies are warranted to ascertain this both in the present population as well as in other ethnic and/or geographic groups of the Indian subcontinent.",2019-04-30,"Adult, Alleles, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2, Female, Gene Frequency, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Variation, Humans, India, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.03.042,Irgam

The objective of this study was to determine antimicrobial resistance profile, virulence genotype and class 1 and 2 integrons in Proteeae isolated from pet turtles and to determine the impact of antibiotic resistance on virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes. Integron-positive isolates were used to detect their gene cassette array. Sixty four Proteeae were isolated and all were resistant to macrolides (100%). Among 64 isolates 56, 52, 36 and 25 were resistant to nitrofurans, β-lactams, tetracycline and aminoglycoside respectively. Sixteen (25%) isolates were positive for intI1 while 14 (21·87%) were positive for integrase 2 (intI2). Eleven (17·18%) isolates were positive for class 1 variable region while 7 (10·93%) were positive for class 2 variable region. IMP27, a novel metallo β-lactamase gene was found in Providencia isolates. Proteus sp. were positive for every tested virulence genes and UreC gene was detected in 48·44% followed by zapA (17·19%), mrpA (17·19%) and hlyA (14·06%) genes. In this study, integron associated-antibiotic resistance genes have been identified in Proteeae isolates in a considerable range representing clear threats to public health. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: In this study, multidrug-resistant Proteeae isolates had several antibiotic resistance genes. Integrons are important contributors to the development and dissemination of antibiotic resistance. We could detect both class 1 and 2 integrons and several gene cassette arrays in class 1 integron. The gene cassette arrays of the Class 2 integrons contained IMP27-dfrA1-aadA1-catB2-ybeA-ybgA in two isolates.

31717396,Genome-Wide Analysis of Members of the WRKY Gene Family and Their Cold Stress Response in Prunus mume.,"Prunus mume, which is a rosaceous arbor with very high ornamental, edible and medical values, has a distribution that is mainly restricted by low temperature. WRKY transcription factor genes play crucial roles in the growth, development, and stress responses of plants. However, the WRKY gene family has not been characterised in P. mume. There were 58 PmWRKYs identified from genome of P. mume. They were anchored onto eight link groups and categorised into three broad groups. The gene structure and motif composition were reasonably conservative in each group. Investigation of gene duplication indicated that nine and seven PmWRKYs were arranged in tandem and segmental duplications, respectively. PmWRKYs were discriminately expressed in different tissues (i.e., roots, stems, leaves, ﬂowers and fruits) in P. mume. The 17 cold-related candidate genes were selected based on RNA-seq data. Further, to investigate the function of PmWRKYs in low temperatures, the expression patterns under artificial cold treatments were analysed. The results showed that the expression levels of the 12 PmWRKYs genes significantly and 5 genes slightly changed in stems. In particular, the expression level of PmWRKY18 was up-regulated after ABA treatment. In addition, the spatiotemporal expression patterns of 17 PmWRKYs were analysed in winter.

We also investigated mutational yield of opportunistic testing of BRCA1/2 and mismatch repair (MMR) genes in all patients. A total of 1,205 unrelated probands with clinical suspicion of hereditary cancer were screened for germline mutations using panel testing. Overall, 1,048 females and 157 males were analyzed, mean age at cancer diagnosis was 48; 883 had hereditary breast/ovarian cancer-suspicion, 205 hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)-suspicion, 73 adenomatous-polyposis-suspicion and 44 with other/multiple clinical criteria. At least one PV was found in 150 probands (12%) analyzed by our customized phenotype-driven panel. Tumoral MMR deficiency predicted for the presence of germline MMR gene mutations in patients with HNPCC-suspicion (46/136 vs. 0/56 in patients with and without MMR deficiency, respectively). Opportunistic testing additionally identified five MSH6, one BRCA1 and one BRCA2 carriers (0.6%).

30018738,InDePTH: detection of hub genes for developing gene expression networks under anticancer drug treatment.,"It has been difficult to elucidate the structure of gene regulatory networks under anticancer drug treatment. Here, we developed an algorithm to highlight the hub genes that play a major role in creating the upstream and downstream relationships within a given set of differentially expressed genes. The directionality of the relationships between genes was defined using information from comprehensive collections of transcriptome profiles after gene knockdown and overexpression. As expected, among the drug-perturbed genes, our algorithm tended to derive plausible hub genes, such as transcription factors. Our validation experiments successfully showed the anticipated activity of certain hub gene in establishing the gene regulatory network that was associated with cell growth inhibition. Notably, giving such top priority to the hub gene was not achieved by ranking fold change in expression and by the conventional gene set enrichment analysis of drug-induced transcriptome data.

32245194,Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies by RT-qPCR in HepaRG Cells during Toxicity Testing and Disease Modelling.,"Gene expression analysis by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is routinely used in biomedical studies. The reproducibility and reliability of the data fundamentally depends on experimental design and data interpretation. Despite the wide application of this assay, there is significant variation in the validation process of gene expression data from research laboratories. Since the validity of results depends on appropriate normalisation, it is crucial to select appropriate reference gene(s), where transcription of the selected gene is unaffected by experimental setting. In this study we have applied geNorm technology to investigate the transcription of 12 'housekeeping' genes for use in the normalisation of RT-qPCR data acquired using a widely accepted HepaRG hepatic cell line in studies examining models of pre-clinical drug testing. geNorm data identified a number of genes unaffected by specific drug treatments and showed that different genes remained invariant in response to different drug treatments, whereas the transcription of 'classical' reference genes such as GAPDH (glyceralde- hyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was altered by drug treatment. Comparing data normalised using the reference genes identified by geNorm with normalisation using classical housekeeping genes demonstrated substantial differences in the final results.

27727313,Endogenous Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies on Bicuspid Aortic Valve Associated Aortopathy in Humans.,"Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease is the most common congenital cardiac abnormality and predisposes patients to life-threatening aortic complications including aortic aneurysm. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is one of the most commonly used methods to investigate underlying molecular mechanisms involved in aortopathy. The accuracy of the gene expression data is dependent on normalization by appropriate housekeeping (HK) genes, whose expression should remain constant regardless of aortic valve morphology, aortic diameter and other factors associated with aortopathy. Here, we identified an appropriate set of HK genes to be used as endogenous reference for quantifying gene expression in ascending aortic tissue using a spin column-based RNA extraction method. Ascending aortic biopsies were collected intra-operatively from patients undergoing aortic valve and/or ascending aortic surgery. These patients had BAV or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV), and the aortas were either dilated (≥4.5cm) or undilated. The cohort had an even distribution of gender, valve disease and hypertension. The expression stability of 12 reference genes were investigated (ATP5B, ACTB, B2M, CYC1, EIF4A2, GAPDH, SDHA, RPL13A, TOP1, UBC, YWHAZ, and 18S) using geNorm software. The most stable HK genes were found to be GAPDH, UBC and ACTB. Both GAPDH and UBC demonstrated relative stability regardless of valve morphology, aortic diameter, gender and age. The expression of B2M and SDHA were found to be the least stable HK genes.

Homeologous ahFAD2A and ahFAD2B genes encode fatty acid desaturases, which are the key enzymes for converting oleic acid to linoleic acid that oxidizes readily. To date, all high oleic acid peanut varieties result from natural mutations occurred in both genes. A method to induce mutations in the genes of other elite cultivars could speed introgression of this valuable trait.

30980945,The Yin and Yang of cancer genes.,"Cancer is caused by malfunctioning of genes that normally regulate cardinal processes including various nuclear functions, cell division and survival, cell surface to nucleus signaling cascades, etc. Cancer associated genes are often classified as oncogenes (OCGs) or tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) depending on whether they promote or suppress tumorigenesis, respectively. Such strict classification of cancer genes may however be an over-simplification. Several studies have highlighted a dual role for cancer genes, often impacting the same facet of tumorigenesis. Knowledge of a possible dichotomy of a cancer gene (particularly an OCG) is imperative when evaluating its possible utility as a therapeutic target. Though previous studies have extensively evaluated specific examples of cancer genes exhibiting a dual nature, efforts to unravel the molecular basis for such contrasting functions have been fewer. The current review is an attempt to delineate molecular events underlying the functional dichotomy of cancer genes at the DNA (mutations, gene fusions, etc.), RNA (alternative splicing, regulation through non-coding RNAs, etc.) and protein (isoforms, mis-localisation, post-translational modifications, proteolytic cleavage, etc.) levels.",2019-06-18,"Animals, Cell Transformation, Neoplastic, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Neoplasm, Genes, Tumor Suppressor, Humans, Mutation, Neoplasms, Oncogenes",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.04.025,Bashyam
28410203,Exploring the key genes and pathways in enchondromas using a gene expression microarray.,"Enchondromas are the most common primary benign osseous neoplasms that occur in the medullary bone; they can undergo malignant transformation into chondrosarcoma. However, enchondromas are always undetected in patients, and the molecular mechanism is unclear. To identify key genes and pathways associated with the occurrence and development of enchondromas, we downloaded the gene expression dataset GSE22855 and obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by analyzing high-throughput gene expression in enchondromas. In total, 635 genes were identified as DEGs. Of these, 225 genes (35.43%) were up-regulated, and the remaining 410 genes (64.57%) were down-regulated. We identified the predominant gene ontology (GO) categories and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways that were significantly over-represented in the enchondromas samples compared with the control samples. Subsequently the top 10 core genes were identified from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The enrichment analyses of the genes mainly involved in two significant modules showed that the DEGs were principally related to ribosomes, protein digestion and absorption, ECM-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, amoebiasis and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway.Together, these data elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the occurrence and development of enchondromas and provide promising candidates for therapeutic intervention and prognostic evaluation. However, further experimental studies are needed to confirm these results.",2018-03-29,"Case-Control Studies, Chondroma, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps, Signal Transduction, Transcriptome",Oncotarget,,Shi

TAB-Methyl-SEQ data were extensively validated by a set of five methodologically different protocols. Importantly, these extensive cross-comparisons revealed that protocols based on Tet1-assisted bisulfite conversion provided more precise hmC values than TrueMethyl-based methods. A total of 109 454 CpG sites were analyzed by TAB-Methyl-SEQ for mC and hmC in 188 genes from 20 different adult human livers. We describe three types of variability of hepatic hmC profiles: (i) sample-specific variability at 40.8% of CpG sites analyzed, where the local hmC values correlate to the global hmC content of livers (measured by LC-MS), (ii) gene-specific variability, where hmC levels in the coding regions positively correlate to expression of the respective gene and (iii) site-specific variability, where prominent hmC peaks span only 1 to 3 neighboring CpG sites. Our data suggest that both the gene- and site-specific components of hmC variability might contribute to the epigenetic control of hepatic genes.

21907770,Analysis of lamprey clustered Fox genes: insight into Fox gene evolution and expression in vertebrates.,"In the human genome, members of the FoxC, FoxF, FoxL1, and FoxQ1 gene families are found in two paralagous clusters. One cluster contains the genes FOXQ1, FOXF2, FOXC1 and the second consists of FOXF1, FOXC2, and FOXL1. In jawed vertebrates these genes are known to be expressed in different pharyngeal tissues and all, except FoxQ1, are involved in patterning the early embryonic mesoderm. We have previously traced the evolution of this cluster in the bony vertebrates, and the gene content is identical in the dogfish, a member of the most basally branching lineage of the jawed vertebrates. Here we extend these analyses to jawless vertebrates. Using genomic searches and molecular approaches we have identified homologues of these genes from lampreys. We identify two FoxC genes, two FoxF genes, two FoxQ1 genes and single FoxL1 gene. We examine the embryonic expression of one predominantly mesodermally expressed gene family, FoxC, and the endodermally expressed member of the cluster, FoxQ1. We identified FoxQ1 transcripts in the pharyngeal endoderm, while the two FoxC genes are differentially expressed in the pharyngeal mesenchyme and ectoderm. Furthermore we identify conserved expression of lamprey FoxC genes in the paraxial and intermediate mesoderms.

Changes in cellular signalling is most commonly studied using the method Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Stable reference genes must be used to accurately quantify target transcript expression. The study aim was to identify suitable reference genes for normalisation of gene expression levels in normal dermal fibroblasts irradiated with either proton or photon beams. The online tool RefFinder was used to analyse and identify the most stably expressed genes from a panel of 22 gene candidates. To assess the reliability of the identified reference genes, a selection of the most and least stable reference genes was used to normalise target transcripts of interest. Fold change levels varied considerably depending on the used reference gene.

Mutations on the epigenetic modifiers could affect the enzyme activity, which would result in the difference in genome-wide methylation profiles and, activation of downstream genes.

30631896,The homeobox gene MaH1 governs microcycle conidiation for increased conidial yield by mediating transcription of conidiation pattern shift-related genes in Metarhizium acridum.,"Conidiation capacity and conidial quality are very important for the production and application of mycopesticides. Most filamentous ascomycetous fungi have two distinct patterns of conidiation. Conidiation through microcycle conidiation proceeds to more rapidly achieve a maximum of conidial yield than normal conidiation and hence is of greater merit for exploitation in mass production of fungal insect pathogens, such as Metarhizium acridum. In this study, the mechanism underlying the conidiation pattern shift in M. acridum was explored by characterization of the fungal homeobox gene MaH1. MaH1 was evidently localized to the nuclei of hyphae and transcriptionally expressed at a maximal level when conidiation began. Intriguingly, deletion of MaH1 in M. acridum resulted in a shift of normal conidiation to microcycle conidiation on one-quarter strength Sabouraud's dextrose agar medium, and hence accelerated conidiation and increased conidial yield. In the deletion mutant, moreover, conidia became larger in size and hyphae cells were shorter in length while conidial virulence and stress tolerance were not altered. As revealed by digital gene expression profiling, MaH1 controlled the shift of conidiation patterns by mediating transcription of a set of genes related to hyphal growth, cell differentiation, conidiation, and some important signaling pathways. These findings indicate that MaH1 and its downstream genes can be exploited to increase the conidial yield for more efficient production of mycopesticides.",2019-06-25,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Biological Control Agents, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Genes, Homeobox, Hyphae, Insecta, Insecticides, Metarhizium, Pest Control, Biological, Spores, Fungal",Appl Microbiol Biotechnol,,Gao

Due to the poor clinical outcomes, it is indispensable to investigate novel biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD. The aim of this study is to explore key genes as potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of COAD for clinical utility. Gene expression profiles (GSE44076 and GSE44861) and gene methylation profile (GSE29490) were analyzed to identify the aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes by R language and Perl software. Function enrichments were performed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Moreover, hub genes were identified through protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Besides, key genes were found by the module analysis and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) survival analysis. Finally, TCGA data and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to validate the key genes involved in COAD. Our study found two hypomethylation-high-expression genes (CXCL3 and CXCL8) in COAD tissues compared with the adjacent normal tissues. These results were also confirmed by RT-qPCR with 25 pairs of COAD and adjacent normal tissues. Meanwhile, low expression of the two genes was associated with poor survival in patients with COAD. CXCL3 and CXCL8 may serve as key genes in the diagnosis and prognosis for COAD.",,,J Cell Physiol,10.1002/jcp.29368,Zhao
27553646,Gene Duplication and Gene Expression Changes Play a Role in the Evolution of Candidate Pollen Feeding Genes in Heliconius Butterflies.,"Heliconius possess a unique ability among butterflies to feed on pollen. Pollen feeding significantly extends their lifespan, and is thought to have been important to the diversification of the genus. We used RNA sequencing to examine feeding-related gene expression in the mouthparts of four species of Heliconius and one nonpollen feeding species, Eueides isabella We hypothesized that genes involved in morphology and protein metabolism might be upregulated in Heliconius because they have longer proboscides than Eueides, and because pollen contains more protein than nectar. Using de novo transcriptome assemblies, we tested these hypotheses by comparing gene expression in mouthparts against antennae and legs. We first looked for genes upregulated in mouthparts across all five species and discovered several hundred genes, many of which had functional annotations involving metabolism of proteins (cocoonase), lipids, and carbohydrates. We then looked specifically within Heliconius where we found eleven common upregulated genes with roles in morphology (CPR cuticle proteins), behavior (takeout-like), and metabolism (luciferase-like). Closer examination of these candidates revealed that cocoonase underwent several duplications along the lineage leading to heliconiine butterflies, including two Heliconius-specific duplications. Luciferase-like genes also underwent duplication within lepidopterans, and upregulation in Heliconius mouthparts. Reverse-transcription PCR confirmed that three cocoonases, a peptidase, and one luciferase-like gene are expressed in the proboscis with little to no expression in labial palps and salivary glands. Our results suggest pollen feeding, like other dietary specializations, was likely facilitated by adaptive expansions of preexisting genes-and that the butterfly proboscis is involved in digestive enzyme production.",2017-09-29,"Adaptation, Physiological, Animals, Butterflies, Diet, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Duplication, Genes, Insect, Insect Proteins, Luciferases, Peptide Hydrolases, Pollen, Proteolysis, Transcriptome",Genome Biol Evol,,Smith

32342269,Identification of gene co-expression modules and hub genes associated with the invasiveness of pituitary adenoma.,"In pituitary adenoma (PA), invasiveness is the main cause of recurrence and poor prognosis. Thus, identifying specific biomarkers for diagnosis and effective treatment of invasive PAs is of great clinical significance. In this study, from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, we obtained and combined several microarrays of PA by the ""sva"" R package. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed to construct a scale-free topology model and analyze the relationships between the modules and clinical traits. Our analysis results indicated that three key modules (dark turquoise, saddle brown, and steel blue) were associated with the invasiveness of PA. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology analysis were performed for the functional annotation of the key modules. In addition, the hub genes in the three modules were identified and screened by differential expression analysis between normal samples and PA samples. Three upregulated differentially expressed genes (DGAT2, PIGZ, and DHRS2) were identified. The Fisher's exact test and receiver operating characteristic curve were used to validate the capability of these genes to distinguish invasive traits, and transcription factor interaction networks were used to further explore the underlying mechanisms of the three genes. Moreover, a lower expression level of DGAT2 in invasive PA tissue than in noninvasive PA tissue was validated by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In general, this study contributes to potential molecular biomarkers of invasive PAs and provides a broader perspective for diagnosis and new therapeutic targets for the invasive PAs.",,,Endocrine,,Zhou

25534030,Comparative transcriptome analyses reveal core parasitism genes and suggest gene duplication and repurposing as sources of structural novelty.,"The origin of novel traits is recognized as an important process underlying many major evolutionary radiations. We studied the genetic basis for the evolution of haustoria, the novel feeding organs of parasitic flowering plants, using comparative transcriptome sequencing in three species of Orobanchaceae. Around 180 genes are upregulated during haustorial development following host attachment in at least two species, and these are enriched in proteases, cell wall modifying enzymes, and extracellular secretion proteins. Additionally, about 100 shared genes are upregulated in response to haustorium inducing factors prior to host attachment. Collectively, we refer to these newly identified genes as putative ""parasitism genes."" Most of these parasitism genes are derived from gene duplications in a common ancestor of Orobanchaceae and Mimulus guttatus, a related nonparasitic plant. Additionally, the signature of relaxed purifying selection and/or adaptive evolution at specific sites was detected in many haustorial genes, and may play an important role in parasite evolution. Comparative analysis of gene expression patterns in parasitic and nonparasitic angiosperms suggests that parasitism genes are derived primarily from root and floral tissues, but with some genes co-opted from other tissues. Gene duplication, often taking place in a nonparasitic ancestor of Orobanchaceae, followed by regulatory neofunctionalization, was an important process in the origin of parasitic haustoria.

24814285,Repeated evolution of chimeric fusion genes in the β-globin gene family of laurasiatherian mammals.,"The evolutionary fate of chimeric fusion genes may be strongly influenced by their recombinational mode of origin and the nature of functional divergence between the parental genes. In the β-globin gene family of placental mammals, the two postnatally expressed δ- and β-globin genes (HBD and HBB, respectively) have a propensity for recombinational exchange via gene conversion and unequal crossing-over. In the latter case, there are good reasons to expect differences in retention rates for the reciprocal HBB/HBD and HBD/HBB fusion genes due to thalassemia pathologies associated with the HBD/HBB ""Lepore"" deletion mutant in humans. Here, we report a comparative genomic analysis of the mammalian β-globin gene cluster, which revealed that chimeric HBB/HBD fusion genes originated independently in four separate lineages of laurasiatherian mammals: Eulipotyphlans (shrews, moles, and hedgehogs), carnivores, microchiropteran bats, and cetaceans. In cases where an independently derived ""anti-Lepore"" duplication mutant has become fixed, the parental HBD and/or HBB genes have typically been inactivated or deleted, so that the newly created HBB/HBD fusion gene is primarily responsible for synthesizing the β-type subunits of adult and fetal hemoglobin (Hb). Contrary to conventional wisdom that the HBD gene is a vestigial relict that is typically inactivated or expressed at negligible levels, we show that HBD-like genes often encode a substantial fraction (20-100%) of β-chain Hbs in laurasiatherian taxa. Our results indicate that the ascendancy or resuscitation of genes with HBD-like coding sequence requires the secondary acquisition of HBB-like promoter sequence via unequal crossing-over or interparalog gene conversion.

29193083,Integrating expression-related SNPs into genome-wide gene- and pathway-based analyses identified novel lung cancer susceptibility genes.,"Traditional pathway analysis map single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to genes according to physical position, which lacks sufficient biological bases. Here, we incorporated genetics of gene expression into gene- and pathway-based analysis to identify genes and pathways associated with lung cancer risk. We identified expression-related SNPs (eSNPs) in lung tissues and integrated these eSNPs into three lung cancer genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including 12,843 lung cancer cases and 12,639 controls. We used SKAT-C for gene-based analysis, and conditional analysis to identify independent eSNPs of each gene. ARTP algorithm was used for pathway analysis. A total of 374,382 eSNPs in the GWAS datasets survived quality control, which were mapped to 5,084 genes and 2,752 pathways. In the gene-based analysis, nine genes showed significant associations with lung cancer risk. Among them, TP63 (3q28), RP11-650L12.2 (15q25.1) and CHRNA5 (15q25.1) were located in known lung cancer susceptibility loci. We also validated two newly identified susceptibility loci (RNASET2 and AL133458.1 in 6q27, and MPZL3 in 11q23.3). Besides, DVL3 (3q27.1), RP11-522I20.3 (9q21.32) and CCDC116 (22q11.21) were identified as novel lung cancer susceptibility genes.

26872362,Identifying Stable Reference Genes for qRT-PCR Normalisation in Gene Expression Studies of Narrow-Leafed Lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.).,"Quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is currently one of the most popular, high-throughput and sensitive technologies available for quantifying gene expression. Its accurate application depends heavily upon normalisation of gene-of-interest data with reference genes that are uniformly expressed under experimental conditions. The aim of this study was to provide the first validation of reference genes for Lupinus angustifolius (narrow-leafed lupin, a significant grain legume crop) using a selection of seven genes previously trialed as reference genes for the model legume, Medicago truncatula. In a preliminary evaluation, the seven candidate reference genes were assessed on the basis of primer specificity for their respective targeted region, PCR amplification efficiency, and ability to discriminate between cDNA and gDNA. Following this assessment, expression of the three most promising candidates [Ubiquitin C (UBC), Helicase (HEL), and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB)] was evaluated using the NormFinder and RefFinder statistical algorithms in two narrow-leafed lupin lines, both with and without vernalisation treatment, and across seven organ types (cotyledons, stem, leaves, shoot apical meristem, flowers, pods and roots) encompassing three developmental stages. UBC was consistently identified as the most stable candidate and has sufficiently uniform expression that it may be used as a sole reference gene under the experimental conditions tested here. However, as organ type and developmental stage were associated with greater variability in relative expression, it is recommended using UBC and HEL as a pair to achieve optimal normalisation. These results highlight the importance of rigorously assessing candidate reference genes for each species across a diverse range of organs and developmental stages.

OS occurrence usually correlates with early metastasis and high death rate. This study aimed to better understand the mechanism of OS metastasis.Based on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, we downloaded 4 expression profile data sets associated with OS metastasis, and selected differential expressed genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach allowed us to investigate the most OS metastasis-correlated module. Gene Ontology functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses were used to give annotation of selected OS metastasis-associated genes.We select 897 differential expressed genes from OS metastasis and OS non-metastasis groups. Based on these selected genes, WGCNA further explored 142 genes included in the most OS metastasis-correlated module. Gene Ontology functional and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses showed that significantly OS metastasis-associated genes were involved in pathway correlated with insulin-like growth factor binding.Our research figured out several potential molecules participating in metastasis process and factors acting as biomarker.

25225046,Functional characterization of calliphorid cell death genes and cellularization gene promoters for controlling gene expression and cell viability in early embryos.,"The New World screwworm fly, Cochliomyia hominivorax, and the Australian sheep blow fly, Lucilia cuprina, are major pests of livestock. The sterile insect technique was used to eradicate C. hominivorax from North and Central America. This involved area-wide releases of male and female flies that had been sterilized by radiation. Genetic systems have been developed for making 'male-only' strains that would improve the efficiency of genetic control of insect pests. One system involves induction of female lethality in embryos through activation of a pro-apoptotic gene by the tetracycline-dependent transactivator. Sex-specific expression is achieved using an intron from the transformer gene, which we previously isolated from several calliphorids. In the present study, we report the isolation of the promoters from the C. hominivorax slam and Lucilia sericata bnk cellularization genes and show that these promoters can drive expression of a GFP reporter gene in early embryos of transgenic L. cuprina. Additionally, we report the isolation of the L. sericata pro-apoptotic hid and rpr genes, identify conserved motifs in the encoded proteins and determine the relative expression of these genes at different stages of development. We show that widespread expression of the L. sericata pro-apoptotic genes was lethal in Drosophila melanogaster.

Compared with diploid watermelon, the tetraploid watermelon often exhibit wide phenotypic differences and differential gene expression. Digital gene expression (DGE) profile technique was performed in this study to present gene expression patterns in an autotetraploid and its progenitor diploid watermelon, and deferentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the abiotic and biotic stress were also addressed. Altogether, 4,985 DEGs were obtained in the autotetraploid against its progenitor diploid, and 66.02% DEGs is up-regulated. GO analysis shows that these DEGs mainly distributed in 'metabolic process', 'cell' and 'catalytic activity'. KEGG analysis revealed that these DEGs mainly cover 'metabolic pathways', 'secondary metabolites' and 'ribosome'. Moreover, 134 tolerance related DEGs were identified which cover osmotic adjustment substance, protective enzymes/protein, signaling proteins and pathogenesis-related proteins.

30184472,Novel symmetry-based gene-gene dissimilarity measures utilizing Gene Ontology: Application in gene clustering.,"In recent years DNA microarray technology, leading to the generation of high-volume biological data, has gained significant attention. To analyze this high volume gene-expression data, one such powerful tool is Clustering. For any clustering algorithm, its efficiency majorly depends upon the underlying similarity/dissimilarity measure. During the analysis of such data often there is a need to further explore the similarity of genes not only with respect to their expression values but also with respect to their functional annotations, which can be obtained from Gene Ontology (GO) databases. In the existing literature, several novel clustering and bi-clustering approaches were proposed to identify co-regulated genes from gene-expression datasets. Identifying co-regulated genes from gene expression data misses some important biological information about functionalities of genes, which is necessary to identify semantically related genes. In this paper, we have proposed sixteen different semantic gene-gene dissimilarity measures utilizing biological information of genes retrieved from a global biological database namely Gene Ontology (GO). Four proximity measures, viz. Euclidean, Cosine, point symmetry and line symmetry are utilized along with four different representations of gene-GO-term annotation vectors to develop total sixteen gene-gene dissimilarity measures. In order to illustrate the profitability of developed dissimilarity measures, some multi-objective as well as single-objective clustering algorithms are applied utilizing proposed measures to identify functionally similar genes from Mouse genome and Yeast datasets. Furthermore, we have compared the performance of our proposed sixteen dissimilarity measures with three existing state-of-the-art semantic similarity and distance measures.",2018-10-22,"Algorithms, Animals, Cluster Analysis, Computational Biology, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Mice, Multigene Family, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.08.062,Acharya
30296179,Identification of valid reference genes for circadian gene-expression studies in human mammary epithelial cells.,"The circadian clock controls most of the physiological processes in the body throughout days and nights' alternation. Its dysregulation has a negative impact on many aspects of human health, such as obesity, lipid disorders, diabetes, skin regeneration, hematopoiesis and cancer. To date, poor is known on the molecular mechanisms that links mammary gland homeostasis to the circadian clock but recent reports highlight the importance of loss of circadian genes for mammary gland development and during tumour progression in breast cancer. Gene expression studies are then required to clarify how the circadian clock can modulates the human mammary gland development during ontology and its behaviour in physiological and oncogenic context. For this, in addition to genome-wide studies, real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) is a powerful and pertinent technique to quantify the expression of a reduced set of genes of interest in many different samples. Relative quantification of qPCR data requires the use of reference genes for normalisation. For circadian studies, reference genes expression must not oscillate in mirror of the circadian clock and must not be affected by the synchronisation protocols required in vitro to reset the circadian clock. Inappropriate selection of reference genes can consequently affect the amplitude of gene expression oscillation and bias data interpretation. Currently, no standard reference genes have been validated regarding these criteria for human mammary epithelial cells and the purpose of this study was to fill this gap. For this, we used the RefFinder tool, which combines four different algorithms, on 9 candidate reference genes. We compared reference genes stability using three different synchronisation protocols applied on four different mammary epithelial cell lines. This allowed us to define a set of reference genes in human mammary epithelial cells whose expression remains stable despite synchronisation protocols. We observed that the synchronisation of cells by serum shock was the most suitable procedure for maintaining the amplitude of oscillation of clock genes over time and we identified RPL4, RPLP0, HSPCB and TBP as an optimal combination of reference genes for the normalisation of the oscillatory expression of clock genes in human mammary epithelial cells.",2019-09-30,"Cells, Cultured, Circadian Clocks, Circadian Rhythm, Epithelial Cells, Gene Expression, Humans, Mammary Glands, Human, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",Chronobiol Int,10.1080/07420528.2018.1508151,Hadadi
31278367,Uncovering biomarker genes with enriched classification potential from Hallmark gene sets.,"Given the complex relationship between gene expression and phenotypic outcomes, computationally efficient approaches are needed to sift through large high-dimensional datasets in order to identify biologically relevant biomarkers. In this report, we describe a method of identifying the most salient biomarker genes in a dataset, which we call ""candidate genes"", by evaluating the ability of gene combinations to classify samples from a dataset, which we call ""classification potential"". Our algorithm, Gene Oracle, uses a neural network to test user defined gene sets for polygenic classification potential and then uses a combinatorial approach to further decompose selected gene sets into candidate and non-candidate biomarker genes. We tested this algorithm on curated gene sets from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) quantified in RNAseq gene expression matrices obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) data repositories. First, we identified which MSigDB Hallmark subsets have significant classification potential for both the TCGA and GTEx datasets. Then, we identified the most discriminatory candidate biomarker genes in each Hallmark gene set and provide evidence that the improved biomarker potential of these genes may be due to reduced functional complexity.",,,Sci Rep,,Targonski

Different drivers often converge in the activation or repression of key cancer-relevant pathways.

29529054,Selection and validation of reference genes for quantitative gene expression analyses in black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) using real-time quantitative PCR.,"Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) is an easy to raise, fast growing, medium-sized deciduous tree species highly tolerant to harsh eco-conditions, i.e., drought and harsh winters, and it is widely adaptable to sandy, loamy, and marshy soils. The basis for this adaptability remains to be investigated at the transcriptomic level using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Selection of a reliable gene for the normalization of qPCR data is important for obtaining accurate results in gene expression. The goal of this study was to identify an appropriate reference gene from 12 candidate genes for gene expression analysis in black locust exposed to various stressors such as abscisic acid (ABA), NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG) and varying temperatures. In GeNorm and NormFinder analyses, ACT (actin) and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) gene expression were the most stable in all conditions except heat stress, but in BestKeeper analysis, GAPDH and helicase gene expression were the most stable under NaCl and heat stress. In contrast, ACT and GAPDH were highest under abscisic acid (ABA), GAPDH and βTUB (beta tubulin) under cold stress, and helicase and EF1α (elongation factor 1 alpha) under PEG stress. We found that the most stable reference gene combination for all conditions was ACT and GAPDH. Additionally, the expression pattern of NAC2 (a transcription factor) and BGL2 in different tissues and under different stress conditions was analyzed relative to ACT and GAPDH and UBQ (ubiquitin) the least stably expressed gene. NAC2 and BGL2 both had highest expression in flowers and pods under ABA stress at 48h. This study provides useful reference genes for future gene expression studies in black locust.",2018-06-29,"Abscisic Acid, Droughts, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Hot Temperature, Polyethylene Glycols, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Robinia, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome",PLoS One,,Wang

21047546,The gsdf gene locus harbors evolutionary conserved and clustered genes preferentially expressed in fish previtellogenic oocytes.,"The gonadal soma-derived factor (GSDF) belongs to the transforming growth factor-β superfamily and is conserved in teleostean fish species. Gsdf is specifically expressed in the gonads, and gene expression is restricted to the granulosa and Sertoli cells in trout and medaka. The gsdf gene expression is correlated to early testis differentiation in medaka and was shown to stimulate primordial germ cell and spermatogonia proliferation in trout. In the present study, we show that the gsdf gene localizes to a syntenic chromosomal fragment conserved among vertebrates although no gsdf-related gene is detected on the corresponding genomic region in tetrapods. We demonstrate using quantitative RT-PCR that most of the genes localized in the synteny are specifically expressed in medaka gonads. Gsdf is the only gene of the synteny with a much higher expression in the testis compared to the ovary. In contrast, gene expression pattern analysis of the gsdf surrounding genes (nup54, aff1, klhl8, sdad1, and ptpn13) indicates that these genes are preferentially expressed in the female gonads. The tissue distribution of these genes is highly similar in medaka and zebrafish, two teleostean species that have diverged more than 110 million years ago. The cellular localization of these genes was determined in medaka gonads using the whole-mount in situ hybridization technique. We confirm that gsdf gene expression is restricted to Sertoli and granulosa cells in contact with the premeiotic and meiotic cells. The nup54 gene is expressed in spermatocytes and previtellogenic oocytes. Transcripts corresponding to the ovary-specific genes (aff1, klhl8, and sdad1) are detected only in previtellogenic oocytes. No expression was detected in the gonocytes in 10 dpf embryos. In conclusion, we show that the gsdf gene localizes to a syntenic chromosomal fragment harboring evolutionary conserved genes in vertebrates. These genes are preferentially expressed in previtelloogenic oocytes, and thus, they display a different cellular localization compared to that of the gsdf gene indicating that the later gene is not co-regulated. Interestingly, our study identifies new clustered genes that are specifically expressed in previtellogenic oocytes (nup54, aff1, klhl8, sdad1).",2011-02-22,"Animals, Female, Fish Proteins, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Genetic Loci, Gonads, Granulosa Cells, Male, Multigene Family, Oocytes, Oryzias, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Sertoli Cells, TGF-beta Superfamily Proteins, Testis, Vitellogenins",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2010.10.014,Gautier
26711304,Acinetobacter baumannii K27 and K44 capsular polysaccharides have the same K unit but different structures due to the presence of distinct wzy genes in otherwise closely related K gene clusters.,"Capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), from Acinetobacter baumannii isolates 1432, 4190 and NIPH 70, which have related gene content at the K locus, were examined, and the chemical structures established using 2D(1)H and(13)C NMR spectroscopy. The three isolates produce the same pentasaccharide repeat unit, which consists of 5-N-acetyl-7-N-[(S)-3-hydroxybutanoyl] (major) or 5,7-di-N-acetyl (minor) derivatives of 5,7-diamino-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-D-glycero-D-galacto-non-2-ulosonic (legionaminic) acid (Leg5Ac7R), D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. However, the linkage between repeat units in NIPH 70 was different to that in 1432 and 4190, and this significantly alters the CPS structure. The KL27 gene cluster in 4190 and KL44 gene cluster in NIPH 70 are organized identically and contain lga genes for Leg5Ac7R synthesis, genes for the synthesis of the common sugars, as well as anitrA2 initiating transferase and four glycosyltransferases genes. They share high-level nucleotide sequence identity for corresponding genes, but differ in the wzy gene encoding the Wzy polymerase. The Wzy proteins, which have different lengths and share no similarity, would form the unrelated linkages in the K27 and K44 structures. The linkages formed by the four shared glycosyltransferases were predicted by comparison with gene clusters that synthesize related structures. These findings unambiguously identify the linkages formed by WzyK27 and WzyK44, and show that the presence of different wzy genes in otherwise closely related K gene clusters changes the structure of the CPS. This may affect its capacity as a protective barrier for A. baumannii.",2016-12-13,"Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacterial Capsules, Bacterial Proteins, Carrier Proteins, Multigene Family, Polysaccharides, Bacterial",Glycobiology,10.1093/glycob/cwv168,Shashkov
32196072,Identification of hub driving genes and regulators of lung adenocarcinoma based on the gene Co-expression network.,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Increasing evidence suggests that circular RNAs (circRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can regulate target gene expression and participate in tumor genesis and progression. However, hub driving genes and regulators playing a potential role in LUAD progression have not been fully elucidated yet. Based on data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, 2837 differentially expressed genes, 741 DE-regulators were screened by comparing cancer tissues with paracancerous tissues. Then, 651 hub driving genes were selected by the topological relation of the protein-protein interaction network. Also, the target genes of DE-regulators were identified. Moreover, a key gene set containing 65 genes was obtained from the hub driving genes and target genes intersection. Subsequently, 183 hub regulators were selected based on the analysis of node degree in the ceRNA network. Next, a comprehensive analysis of the subgroups and Wnt, mTOR, and MAPK signaling pathways was conducted to understand enrichment of the subgroups. Survival analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were further used to screen for the key genes and regulators. Furthermore, we verified key molecules based on external database, LRRK2, PECAM1, EPAS1, LDB2, and HOXA11-AS showed good results. LRRK2 was further identified as promising biomarker associated with CNV alteration and various immune cells' infiltration levels in LUAD. Overall, the present study provided a novel perspective and insight into hub driving genes and regulators in LUAD, suggesting that the identified signature could serve as an independent prognostic biomarker.",,,Biosci Rep,,Xu

In order to identify stable and reliable expressed genes in mycoparasite Clonostachys rosea in different modes of nutrition, seven commonly used housekeeping genes, 18S rRNA, actin, β-tubulin, elongation factor 1, ubiquitin, ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, from the effective biocontrol isolate C. rosea 67-1 were tested for their expression under sclerotial induction and during vegetative growth on PDA medium. Analysis by three software programs showed that differences existed among the candidates. Elongation factor 1 was most stable; the M value in geNorm, SD value in Bestkeeper and stability value in Normfinder analysis were 0.405, 0.450 and 0.442, respectively, indicating that the gene elongation factor 1 could be used to normalize gene expression in C. rosea in both vegetative growth and parasitic process. By using elongation factor 1, the expression of a serine protease gene, sep, in different conditions was assessed, which was consistent with the transcriptomic data. This research provides an effective method to quantitate expression changes of target genes in C. rosea, and will assist in further investigation of parasitism-related genes of this fungus.

28190458,Detection of Imprinted Genes by Single-Cell Allele-Specific Gene Expression.,"Genomic imprinting results in parental-specific gene expression. Imprinted genes are involved in the etiology of rare syndromes and have been associated with common diseases such as diabetes and cancer. Standard RNA bulk cell sequencing applied to whole-tissue samples has been used to detect imprinted genes in human and mouse models. However, lowly expressed genes cannot be detected by using RNA bulk approaches. Here, we report an original and robust method that combines single-cell RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing into an optimized statistical framework to analyze genomic imprinting in specific cell types and in different individuals. Using samples from the probands of 2 family trios and 3 unrelated individuals, 1,084 individual primary fibroblasts were RNA sequenced and more than 700,000 informative heterozygous single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were genotyped. The allele-specific coverage per gene of each SNV in each single cell was used to fit a beta-binomial distribution to model the likelihood of a gene being expressed from one and the same allele. Genes presenting a significant aggregate allelic ratio (between 0.9 and 1) were retained to identify of the allelic parent of origin. Our approach allowed us to validate the imprinting status of all of the known imprinted genes expressed in fibroblasts and the discovery of nine putative imprinted genes, thereby demonstrating the advantages of single-cell over bulk RNA-seq to identify imprinted genes. The proposed single-cell methodology is a powerful tool for establishing a cell type-specific map of genomic imprinting.",2017-05-10,"Alleles, Cell Line, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression, Genetic Association Studies, Genomic Imprinting, Genotyping Techniques, Heterozygote, Humans, Models, Theoretical, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Single-Cell Analysis, Transcriptome",Am J Hum Genet,,Santoni

However, the causal genes expression and pathways of ADHD is still vague. We integrated GWAS, eQTL and genes expression data to find the causal genes, genes expression, and genes prioritization in the different brain tissues and whole blood cells. Overall 47 genes were prioritized, the most promising genes were LSG1, HYAL3, PIDD, PNPLA2, BLOC1S2, PLK1S1, CALN1, KAT2B, CTNNB1 and WDR11. Whereas, the CALN1, KAT2B, and WDR11 were previously associated with schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar (BP) and drug abuse.

The aim was to determine whether predicted intrinsic protein disorder was differentially associated with proteins encoded by genes that are differentially regulated in lymphoma cells upon interaction with stromal cells, an interaction that occurs in microenvironments, such as lymph nodes that are protective for lymphoma cells during chemotherapy. Intrinsic disorder protein properties were extracted from the Database of Disordered Protein Prediction (D²P²), which contains data from nine intrinsic disorder predictors. Proteins encoded by differentially regulated cell-adhesion regulated genes were enriched in intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) compared to other genes both with regard to IDR number and length. The enrichment was further ascribed to down-regulated genes. Consistently, a higher proportion of proteins encoded by down-regulated genes contained at least one IDR or were completely disordered. We conclude that down-regulated genes in stromal cell-adherent lymphoma cells encode proteins that are characterized by elevated levels of intrinsically disordered conformation, indicating the importance of down-regulating functional mechanisms associated with intrinsically disordered proteins in these cells. Further, the approach provides a generally applicable and complementary alternative to classification of differentially regulated genes using gene ontology or pathway enrichment analysis.",2019-01-15,"Cell Adhesion, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Intrinsically Disordered Proteins, Lymphoma, Transcriptome",Int J Mol Sci,,Arvidsson
30624703,Evaluation of Reference Genes for Normalization of RT-qPCR Gene Expression Data for Trichoplusia ni Cells During Antheraea pernyi (Lepidoptera: Saturniidae) Multicapsid Nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV) Infection.,"Baculovirus infection impacts global gene expression in the host cell, including the expression of housekeeping genes. Evaluation of candidate reference genes during a viral infection will inform the selection of appropriate reference gene(s) for the normalization of expression data generated by Reverse Transcription Quantitative Real-timePolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR). Antheraea pernyi multicapsid nucleopolyhedrovirus (AnpeNPV) is able to infect the High Five cells (Tn-Hi5). In the present study, 10 candidate reference genes were evaluated in AnpeNPV-infected Tn-Hi5 cells. Gene expression data were analyzed using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The candidate genes were further validated as reliable reference genes for RT-qPCR by analyzing the expression of three target genes. The results of data analysis using four statistical methods showed that RPS18 was the least stable among the candidate reference genes tested. 18S rRNA and 28S rRNA were not suitable as reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in AnpeNPV-infected Tn-Hi5 cells. Comprehensive ranking of the 10 candidate reference genes by RefFinder analysis indicated that Ann B, c45128_g1, and ACT were the top three genes. Normalization of the expression of three target genes using the candidate reference genes indicated the same expression pattern when Ann B and c45128_g1 were used as reference genes, with slight differences in the relative expression at each infection time point.

A total of 50, 54 and 28 members of the TIFY gene family in three cultivated cotton species-Gossypium hirsutum, Gossypium barbadense and Gossypium arboretum-were identified, respectively. The results of phylogenetic analysis showed that these TIFY genes were divided into eight clusters. The different clusters of gene family members often have similar gene structures, including the number of exons. The results of quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) showed that different JAZ genes displayed distinct expression patterns in the leaves of upland cotton under treatment with Gibberellin (GA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), Jasmonic acid (JA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Different groups of JAZ genes exhibited different expression patterns in cotton leaves infected with Verticillium dahliae.

In cold-blooded vertebrates and, in particular, the tropical fish Danio rerio, the α- and β-globin genes form two gene clusters. A major D. rerio globin gene cluster is in chromosome 3 and includes the α- and β-globin genes of embryonic-larval and adult types. The region upstream of the cluster contains c16orf35, harbors the main regulatory element (MRE) of the α-globin gene domain in warm-blooded vertebrates. In this study, transient transfection of erythroid cells with genetic constructs containing a reporter gene under the control of potential regulatory elements of the domain was performed to characterize the promoters of the embryonic-larval and adult α- and β-globin genes of the major cluster. Also, in the 5th intron of c16orf35 in Danio reriowas detected a functional analog of the warm-blooded vertebrate MRE.

31318337,Mining conditions specific hub genes from RNA-Seq gene-expression data via biclustering and their application to drug discovery.,"Gene-expression data is being widely used for various clinical research. It represents expression levels of thousands of genes across the various experimental conditions simultaneously. Mining conditions specific hub genes from gene-expression data is a challenging task. Conditions specific hub genes signify the functional behaviour of bicluster across the subset of conditions and can act as prognostic or diagnostic markers of the diseases. In this study, the authors have introduced a new approach for identifying conditions specific hub genes from the RNA-Seq data using a biclustering algorithm. In the proposed approach, efficient 'runibic' biclustering algorithm, the concept of gene co-expression network and concept of protein-protein interaction network have been used for getting better performance. The result shows that the proposed approach extracts biologically significant conditions specific hub genes which play an important role in various biological processes and pathways. These conditions specific hub genes can be used as prognostic or diagnostic biomarkers. Conditions specific hub genes will be helpful to reduce the analysis time and increase the accuracy of further research.

30287891,Gene ontology enrichment analysis of congenital diaphragmatic hernia-associated genes.,"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a commonly occurring major congenital anomaly with a profound impact on neonatal mortality. The etiology of CDH is poorly understood and is complicated by multiple clinical presentations, reflecting the location and type of diaphragm defect. With the increased power of genetic screening, more genes are being associated with CDH, creating a knowledge gap between CDH-associated genes and their contribution to diaphragm embryogenesis. Our goal was to investigate CDH-associated genes and identify common pathways that may lead to abnormal diaphragm development. A comprehensive list of CDH-associated genes was identified from the literature and categorized according to multiple factors, including type of CDH. We undertook a large-scale gene function analysis using gene ontology to identify significantly enriched biological pathways and molecular functions associated with our gene set. We identified 218 CDH-associated genes. Our gene ontology analysis showed that genes representing distinct biological pathways are significantly enriched in relation to different clinical presentations of CDH. This includes retinoic acid signaling in Bochdalek CDH, myogenesis in diaphragm eventration, and angiogenesis in central tendon defects. We have identified unique genotype-phenotype relationships highlighting the major genetic drivers of the different types of CDH.",2020-03-12,"Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genetic Markers, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Hernias, Diaphragmatic, Congenital, Humans, Phenotype, Signal Transduction",Pediatr Res,,Dalmer

26277249,Genome-wide selection of superior reference genes for expression studies in Ganoderma lucidum.,"Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is widely used for the accurate analysis of gene expression. However, high homology among gene families might result in unsuitability of reference genes, which leads to the inaccuracy of qRT-PCR analysis. The release of the Ganoderma lucidum genome has triggered numerous studies to be done on the homology among gene families with the purpose of selecting reliable reference genes. Based on the G. lucdum genome and transcriptome database, 38 candidate reference genes including 28 novel genes were systematically selected and evaluated for qRT-PCR normalization. The result indicated that commonly used polyubiquitin (PUB), beta-actin (BAT), and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were unsuitable reference genes because of the high sequence similarity and low primer specificity. According to the evaluation of RefFinder, cyclophilin 5 (CYP5) was ranked as the most stable reference gene for 27 tested samples under all experimental conditions and eighteen mycelial samples. Based on sequence analysis and expression analysis, our study suggested that gene characteristic, primer specificity of high homologous genes, allele-specificity expression of candidate genes and under-evaluation of reference genes influenced the accuracy and sensitivity of qRT-PCR analysis. This investigation not only revealed potential factors influencing the unsuitability of reference genes but also selected the superior reference genes from more candidate genes and testing samples than those used in the previous study.

27308855,Identification of Reference Genes for Quantitative Gene Expression Studies in a Non-Model Tree Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.).,"The tree species, Pistacia vera (P. vera) is an important commercial product that is salt-tolerant and long-lived, with a possible lifespan of over one thousand years. Gene expression analysis is an efficient method to explore the possible regulatory mechanisms underlying these characteristics. Therefore, having the most suitable set of reference genes is required for transcript level normalization under different conditions in P. vera. In the present study, we selected eight widely used reference genes, ACT, EF1α, α-TUB, β-TUB, GAPDH, CYP2, UBQ10, and 18S rRNA. Using qRT-PCR their expression was assessed in 54 different samples of three cultivars of P. vera. The samples were collected from different organs under various abiotic treatments (cold, drought, and salt) across three time points. Several statistical programs (geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were applied to estimate the expression stability of candidate reference genes. Results obtained from the statistical analysis were then exposed to Rank aggregation package to generate a consensus gene rank. Based on our results, EF1α was found to be the superior reference gene in all samples under all abiotic treatments. In addition to EF1α, ACT and β-TUB were the second best reference genes for gene expression analysis in leaf and root. We recommended β-TUB as the second most stable gene for samples under the cold and drought treatments, while ACT holds the same position in samples analyzed under salt treatment.

In this paper, the multi-copied protein coding genes in a number of prokaryotic genomes are comprehensively analyzed firstly. The results show that 0-15.93% of the protein coding genes in each genome are multi-copied genes and 0-16.49% of the protein coding genes in each genome are highly similar with the sequence identity ≥ 80%. Function and COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) analysis shows that 64.64% of multi-copied genes concentrate on the function of transposase and 86.28% of the COG assigned multi-copied genes concentrate on the COG code of 'L'. Furthermore, the impact of redundant protein coding sequences on the gene prediction results is studied. The results show that the problem of protein coding sequence redundancies cannot be ignored and the consistency of the gene annotation results before and after excluding the redundant sequences is negatively related with the sequences redundancy degree of the protein coding sequences in the training set.",2016-02-04,"Bacteria, Gene Dosage, Gene Duplication, Genes, Bacterial, Open Reading Frames",J Theor Biol,10.1016/j.jtbi.2015.04.002,Yu

However, little information about the sex-related genes in embryonic development stages were exposed. To obtain more information of sex determination in Chinese mitten crab, we performed the transcriptome analysis in embryonic development stage (fertilized egg stage, cleavage stage, blastula stage, gastrula stage and heartbeat stage) of Chinese mitten crab using nextgeneration sequencing technology. Thirty-one of 32,088 annotated unigenes were identified as sex-related genes including 16 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms and 8 genes of SOX family and 7 genes of DMRT gene family. Heatmap based on the RPKM value in five embryonic development stages indicated that these genes were clustered into two branches. Analysis of the differentially expressed 12 genes, including 3 genes of SOX family, 3 genes of DMRT gene family and 6 genes involved in primary sex determination in model organisms, showed significantly difference between the first three periods (fertilized egg stage-cleavage stage-blastula stage) and the last two periods (gastrula stage-heartbeat stage) and all 12 genes were up-regulated after blastula stage.

The SNPs of 17 patients and the preprocessed SNP profiling GSE 32258 (38 cases of normal breast cells) were combined to identify their correlation with breast cancer using chi-square test. The gene expression profiling batch8_9 (38 cases of patients and 8 cases of normal tissue) was preprocessed with limma package, and the DEGs were filtered out. Then fisher's method was applied to integrate DEGs and SNPs associated with breast cancer. With NetBox software, TRED (Transcriptional Regulatory Element Database) and UCSC (University of California Santa Cruz) database, genes-associated network and transcriptional regulatory network were constructed using cytoscape software. Further, GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG analyses were performed for genes in the networks by using siggenes. In total, 332 DEGs were identified. There were 160 breast cancer-related SNPs related to 106 genes of gene expression profiling (19 were significant DEGs). Finally, 11co-correlated DEGs were selected. In genes-associated network, 9 significant DEGs were correlated to 23 LINKER genes while, in transcriptional regulatory network, E2F1 had regulatory relationships with 7 DEGs including MTUS1, CD44, CCNB1 and CCND2. KRAS with SNP locus of rs1137282 was involved in 35 KEGG pathways. The genes of MTUS1, CD44, CCNB1, CCND2 and KRAS with specific SNP loci may be used as biomarkers for diagnosis of breast cancer.

30204242,Functional and structural profiles of GST gene family from three Populus species reveal the sequence-function decoupling of orthologous genes.,"A common assumption in comparative genomics is that orthologous genes are functionally more similar than paralogous genes. However, the validity of this assumption needs to be assessed using robust experimental data. We conducted tissue-specific gene expression and protein function analyses of orthologous groups within the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene family in three closely related Populus species: Populus trichocarpa, Populus euphratica and Populus yatungensis. This study identified 21 GST orthologous groups in the three Populus species. Although the sequences of the GST orthologous groups were highly conserved, the divergence in enzymatic functions was prevalent. Through site-directed mutagenesis of orthologous proteins, this study revealed that nonsynonymous substitutions at key amino acid sites played an important role in the divergence of enzymatic functions. In particular, a single amino acid mutation (Arg39→Trp39) contributed to P. euphratica PeGSTU30 possessing high enzymatic activity via increasing the hydrophobicity of the active cavity. This study provided experimental evidence showing that orthologues belonging to the gene family have functional divergences. The nonsynonymous substitutions at a few amino acid sites resulted in functional divergence of the orthologous genes.

31051114,Genes with High Network Connectivity Are Enriched for Disease Heritability.,"Recent studies have highlighted the role of gene networks in disease biology. To formally assess this, we constructed a broad set of pathway, network, and pathway+network annotations and applied stratified LD score regression to 42 diseases and complex traits (average N = 323K) to identify enriched annotations. First, we analyzed 18,119 biological pathways. We identified 156 pathway-trait pairs whose disease enrichment was statistically significant (FDR < 5%) after conditioning on all genes and 75 known functional annotations (from the baseline-LD model), a stringent step that greatly reduced the number of pathways detected; most significant pathway-trait pairs were previously unreported. Next, for each of four published gene networks, we constructed probabilistic annotations based on network connectivity. For each gene network, the network connectivity annotation was strongly significantly enriched. Surprisingly, the enrichments were fully explained by excess overlap between network annotations and regulatory annotations from the baseline-LD model, validating the informativeness of the baseline-LD model and emphasizing the importance of accounting for regulatory annotations in gene network analyses. Finally, for each of the 156 enriched pathway-trait pairs, for each of the four gene networks, we constructed pathway+network annotations by annotating genes with high network connectivity to the input pathway. For each gene network, these pathway+network annotations were strongly significantly enriched for the corresponding traits. Once again, the enrichments were largely explained by the baseline-LD model. In conclusion, gene network connectivity is highly informative for disease architectures, but the information in gene networks may be subsumed by regulatory annotations, emphasizing the importance of accounting for known annotations.",2020-02-06,"Computational Biology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Genetic Diseases, Inborn, Humans, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Multifactorial Inheritance, Phenotype, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait, Heritable, Software",Am J Hum Genet,,Kim

28190221,Analysis of gene expression in the nervous system identifies key genes and novel candidates for health and disease.,"The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases in the developed world has risen over the last century, concomitant with an increase in average human lifespan. A major challenge is therefore to identify genes that control neuronal health and viability with a view to enhancing neuronal health during ageing and reducing the burden of neurodegeneration. Analysis of gene expression data has recently been used to infer gene functions for a range of tissues from co-expression networks. We have now applied this approach to transcriptomic datasets from the mammalian nervous system available in the public domain. We have defined the genes critical for influencing neuronal health and disease in different neurological cell types and brain regions. The functional contribution of genes in each co-expression cluster was validated using human disease and knockout mouse phenotypes, pathways and gene ontology term annotation. Additionally a number of poorly annotated genes were implicated by this approach in nervous system function. Exploiting gene expression data available in the public domain allowed us to validate key nervous system genes and, importantly, to identify additional genes with minimal functional annotation but with the same expression pattern.

Clonally related cells typically share the same germline gene segments and have highly similar junctional sequences within their third complementarity determining regions. Identifying clonal relatedness of sequences is a key step in the analysis of immune repertoires. The V gene is the most important for clone identification because it has the longest sequence and the greatest number of sequence variants. However, accurate identification of a clone's germline V gene source is challenging because there is a high degree of similarity between different germline V genes. This difficulty is compounded in antibodies, which can undergo somatic hypermutation. Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing experiments often generate partial sequences and have significant error rates. To address these issues, we describe a novel method to estimate which germline V genes (or alleles) cannot be discriminated under different conditions (read lengths, sequencing errors or somatic hypermutation frequencies). Starting with any set of germline V genes, this method measures their similarity using different sequencing lengths and calculates their likelihood of unambiguous assignment under different levels of mutation. Hence, one can identify, under different experimental and biological conditions, the germline V genes (or alleles) that cannot be uniquely identified and bundle them together into groups of specific V genes with highly similar sequences.

29166265,Selection of reference genes for quantitative real-time RT-PCR on gene expression in Golden Pompano (Trachinotus ovatus).,"Golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus) is an important economically fish species. In this study, with an aim to identify reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in golden pompano, we evaluated the expression stability of eight housekeeping genes in the presence and absence of poly I:C stimulation in eight tissues. The PCR data was analyzed by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that the expression of all the examined genes exhibited tissue-dependent variations. When under normal physiological condition, geNorm and NormFinder identified B2M and 18S as suitable genes. When studying gene expression under conditions of poly I:C stimulation, the selection of the internal controls should be selected on a tissue basis. At 12 h stimulation, geNorm ranked Actin/UBCE, Actin/B2M, UBCE/B2M, Actin/UBCE, RPL13/B2M, UBCE/GAPDH, B2M/RPL13, and UBCE/B2M, respectively, as the most stably expressed genes in liver, spleen, kidney, gill, intestine, heart, muscle, and brain. Comparable ranking orders were produced by NormFinder. Similar results were obtained at 48 h stimulation. Taken together, these results indicate that B2M and 18S are the most stable gene across tissue types under normal physiological conditions. However, during poly I:C stimulation, no single gene or single pair of genes in the examined set of housekeeping genes can serve as a universal reference across all tissue types. If one gene is preferred, B2M, B2M, UBCE, Actin, B2M/RPL13, B2M, B2M, and RPL13 may be used in spleen, kidney, liver, gill, intestine, brain, muscle, and heart of golden pompano, respectively.",2019-07-31,"Animals, Fishes, Gene Expression Regulation, RNA, Messenger, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Transcriptome",Pol J Vet Sci,,Chen

28911201,Gene expression profiling of puberty-associated genes reveals abundant tissue and sex-specific changes across postnatal development.,"The timing of human puberty is highly variable, sexually dimorphic, and associated with adverse health outcomes. Over 20 genes carrying rare mutations have been identified in known pubertal disorders, many of which encode critical components of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified more than 100 candidate genes at loci associated with age at menarche or voice breaking in males. We know little about the spatial, temporal or postnatal expression patterns of the majority of these puberty-associated genes. Using a high-throughput and sensitive microfluidic quantitative PCR strategy, we profiled the gene expression patterns of the mouse orthologs of 178 puberty-associated genes in male and female mouse HPG axis tissues, the pineal gland, and the liver at five postnatal ages spanning the pubertal transition. The most dynamic gene expression changes were observed prior to puberty in all tissues. We detected known and novel tissue-enhanced gene expression patterns, with the hypothalamus expressing the largest number of the puberty-associated genes. Notably, over 40 puberty-associated genes in the pituitary gland showed sex-biased gene expression, most of which occurred peri-puberty. These sex-biased genes included the orthologs of candidate genes at GWAS loci that show sex-discordant effects on pubertal timing. Our findings provide new insight into the expression of puberty-associated genes and support the possibility that the pituitary plays a role in determining sex differences in the timing of puberty.",2018-01-18,"Animals, Female, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Genome-Wide Association Study, Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System, Hypothalamus, Male, Mice, Microarray Analysis, Pituitary Gland, Pituitary-Adrenal System, Sex Characteristics, Sex Factors, Sexual Maturation, Transcriptome",Hum Mol Genet,,Hou
28035715,Sequence diversity patterns suggesting balancing selection in partially sex-linked genes of the plant Silene latifolia are not generated by demographic history or gene flow.,"DNA sequence diversity in genes in the partially sex-linked pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the sex chromosomes of the plant Silene latifolia is higher than expected from within-species diversity of other genes. This could be the footprint of sexually antagonistic (SA) alleles that are maintained by balancing selection in a PAR gene (or genes) and affect polymorphism in linked genome regions. SA selection is predicted to occur during sex chromosome evolution, but it is important to test whether the unexpectedly high sequence polymorphism could be explained without it, purely by the combined effects of partial linkage with the sex-determining region and the population's demographic history, including possible introgression from Silene dioica. To test this, we applied approximate Bayesian computation-based model choice to autosomal sequence diversity data, to find the most plausible scenario for the recent history of S. latifolia and then to estimate the posterior density of the most relevant parameters. We then used these densities to simulate variation to be expected at PAR genes. We conclude that an excess of variants at high frequencies at PAR genes should arise in S. latifolia populations only for genes with strong associations with fully sex-linked genes, which requires closer linkage with the fully sex-linked region than that estimated for the PAR genes where apparent deviations from neutrality were observed. These results support the need to invoke selection to explain the S. latifolia PAR gene diversity, and encourage further work to test the possibility of balancing selection due to sexual antagonism.",2018-01-30,"Bayes Theorem, Chromosomes, Plant, Gene Flow, Genes, Plant, Models, Genetic, Selection, Genetic, Silene",Mol Ecol,10.1111/mec.13969,Guirao-Rico
30775801,Prognostic genes of hepatocellular carcinoma based on gene coexpression network analysis.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common subtype in liver cancer whose prognosis is affected by malignant progression associated with complex gene interactions. However, there is currently no available biomarkers associated with HCC progression in clinical application. In our study, RNA sequencing expression data of 50 normal samples and 374 tumor samples was analyzed and 9225 differentially expressed genes were screened. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis was then conducted and the blue module we were interested was identified by calculating the correlations between 17 gene modules and clinical features. In the blue module, the calculation of topological overlap was applied to select the top 30 genes and these 30 genes were divided into the green group (11 genes) and the yellow group (19 genes) through searching whether these genes were validated by in vitro or in vivo experiments. The genes in the green group which had never been validated by any experiments were recognized as hub genes. These hub genes were subsequently validated by a new data set GSE76427 and KM Plotter Online Tool, and the results indicated that 10 genes (FBXO43, ARHGEF39, MXD3, VIPR1, DNASE1L3, PHLDA1, CSRNP1, ADR2B, C1RL, and CDC37L1) could act as prognosis and progression biomarkers of HCC. In summary, 10 genes who have never been mentioned in HCC were identified to be associated with malignant progression and prognosis of patients. These findings may contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic decision, risk stratification, and prognosis prediction for HCC patients.",,,J Cell Biochem,10.1002/jcb.28441,Xu

This study aimed to determine the integron types, gene cassettes, virulence determinants, β-lactam resistance genes, biofilm formation and alginate production in P. aeruginosa isolated from Iranian CF patients. A total of 143 P. aeruginosa isolates were obtained from CF patients. Susceptibility of isolates to different antimicrobials was evaluated by disc diffusion method. ESBL, MBL and KPC production was assessed. Congo red agar and tissue culture plates were used for evaluation of biofilm formation. Alginate production was determined using the Carbazole assay. Integrase genes, resistance determinants (ESBLs, MBLs and KPC) and genes encoding virulence factors were evaluated by PCR. All isolates were susceptible to colistin, piperacillin-tazobactam and ticarcillin; 8.4% of isolates were considered as MDR phenotype. Out of 6.3% IPM-resistant isolates, prevalence of virulence genes was as follows: lasB (100%) and plcB (100%), plcH (96.5%). Biofilm formation and alginate production ability were found in 54.5% of isolates. The prevalence of the alginate-encoding genes was 92.3%, 86.7% and 67.1% for algD, algU and algL genes, respectively. PpyR, pslA and pelA genes were detected in 98.6%, 89.5% and 57.3% of the isolates, respectively. The high prevalence of colonization in CF lungs may increase the pathogenicity of P. aeruginosa due to their adhesion and protective properties caused by biofilm- and alginate-production.

Although some salt responsive genes have been identified in rice, their applications in developing salt tolerant cultivars have resulted in limited achievements. Herein, we used bioinformatic approaches to perform a meta-analysis of three transcriptome datasets from salinity and control conditions in order to reveal novel genes and the molecular pathways underlying rice response to salt. From a total of 28,432 expressed genes, we identify 457 core differentially expressed genes (DEGs) constitutively responding to salt, regardless of the stress duration, genotype, or the tissue. Gene co-expression analysis divided the core DEGs into three different modules, each of them contributing to salt response in a unique metabolic pathway. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses highlighted key biological processes and metabolic pathways involved in the salt response. We identified important novel hub genes encoding proteins of different families including CAM, DUF630/632, DUF581, CHL27, PP2-13, LEA4-5, and transcription factors, which could be functionally characterized using reverse genetic experiments.

32193506,Selection of reference genes for normalization of RT-qPCR data in gene expression studies in Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae).,"The pepper weevil, Anthonomus eugenii Cano (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is the main insect pest of peppers (Capsicum spp.) throughout the southern U.S. and a potential target for novel control methods that may require gene expression analyses. Careful selection of adequate reference genes to normalize RT-qPCR data is an important prerequisite for gene expression studies since the expression stability of reference genes can be affected by the experimental conditions leading to biased or erroneous results. The lack of studies on validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis in A. eugenii limits the investigation of gene expression, therefore it is needed a systematic selection of suitable reference genes for data normalization. In the present study, three programs (BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder) were used to analyze the expression stability of candidate reference genes (β-ACT, ArgK, EF1-α, GAPDH, RPL12, RPS23, α-TUB, 18S and 28S) in A. eugenii under different experimental conditions. Our results revealed that the most stably expressed reference genes in A. eugenii varied according to the experimental condition evaluated: developmental stages (EF1-α, 18S and RPL12), sex (RPS23 and RPL12), low temperature (GAPDH and α-TUB), high temperature (α-TUB and RPS23), all temperatures (α-TUB and GAPDH), starvation (RPL12 and α-TUB), and dsRNA exposure (α-TUB and RPL12).

30379684,Impact of catechol-O-methyltransferase gene variants on methylation status of P16 and MGMT genes and their downregulation in colorectal cancer.,"Globally, colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second most commonly diagnosed cancer in females, with 1.4 million new cases and almost 694 000 deaths estimated to have occurred in 2012. The development and progression of CRC is dictated by a series of alterations in diverse genes mostly proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. In this dreadful disease disturbances different from mutations called as epigenetic regulations are also taken into consideration and are thoroughly investigated. The present study was designed to analyze the promoter hypermethylation of CpG (cytosine, followed by guanine nucleotide) islands of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (P16) and O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) genes and its subsequent effect on the protein expression in CRC. The impact of the common functional polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, Val158Met, on promoter hypermethylation of P16 and MGMT genes in CRC was also investigated. The study included 200 CRC cases and equal numbers of normal samples. DNA was extracted using the kit method and methylation specific-PCR was performed for analysis of the promoter hypermethylation status. Total protein was isolated form all CRC cases and western blotting was performed for P16 and MGMT proteins. The COMT Val158Met polymorphism was analyzed by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Epigenetic analysis showed that unlike other high-risk regions, the Kashmiri population has a different promoter hypermethylation profile of both P16 and MGMT genes, with frequent and significant promoter hypermethylation of both in CRC. The frequency of promoter hypermethylation of both genes was significantly higher in males and was insignificantly found to be higher in stage III/IV. The degree of P16 and MGMT promoter hypermethylation increased significantly with increasing severity of the lesion. We also found a significant correlation between P16 and MGMT promoter hypermethylation and loss of protein expression in CRC.

Plants possess two types of phosphofructokinase proteins for phosphorylation of fructose-6-phosphate, the pyrophosphate-dependent fructose-6-phosphate phosphotransferase (PFP), and the ATP-dependent phosphofructokinase (PFK). Until now, the gene evolution, expression patterns, and functions of phosphofructokinase proteins were unknown in pear. In this report, 14 phosphofructokinase genes were identified in pear. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene family could be grouped into two subfamilies, with 10 genes belonging to the PbPFK subfamily, and 4 genes belonging to the PbPFP subfamily. Conserved motifs and exon numbers of the phosphofructokinase were found in pear and other six species. The evolution analysis indicated that WGD/Segmental and dispersed duplications were the main duplication models for the phosphofructokinase genes expansion in pear and other six species. Analysis of cis-regulatory element sequences of all phosphofructokinase genes identified light regulation and the MYB binding site in the promoter of all pear phosphofructokinase genes, suggesting that phosphofructokinase might could be regulated by light and MYB transcription factors (TFs). Gene expression patterns revealed that PbPFP1 showed similar pattern with sorbitol contents, suggesting important contributions to sugar accumulation during fruit development. Further functional analysis indicated that the phosphofructokinase gene PbPFP1 was localized on plasma membrane compartment, indicating that PbPFP1 had function in plasma membrane. Transient transformation of PbPFP1 in pear fruits led to significant increases of fructose and sorbitol compared to controls.

Br.] a widely used grain and forage crop, is grown in areas frequented with one or more abiotic stresses, has superior drought and heat tolerance and considered a model crop for stress tolerance studies. Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target stress-responsive gene expression through quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR is important for elucidating the molecular mechanisms of improved stress tolerance. For precise normalization of gene expression data in pearl millet, ten candidate reference genes were examined in various developmental tissues as well as under different individual abiotic stresses and their combinations at 1 h (early) and 24 h (late) of stress using geNorm, NormFinder and RefFinder algorithms. Our results revealed EF-1α and UBC-E2 as the best reference genes across all samples, the specificity of which was confirmed by assessing the relative expression of a PgAP2 like-ERF gene that suggested use of these two reference genes is sufficient for accurate transcript normalization under different stress conditions. To our knowledge this is the first report on validation of reference genes under different individual and multiple abiotic stresses in pearl millet. The study can further facilitate fastidious discovery of stress-tolerance genes in this important stress-tolerant crop.

29738539,"Gene dosage effects in yeast support broader roles for the LOG1, HAM1 and DUT1 genes in detoxification of nucleotide analogues.","Purine and pyrimidine analogues have important uses in chemotherapies against cancer, and a better understanding of the mechanisms that cause resistance to these drugs is therefore of importance in cancer treatment. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, overexpression of the HAM1 gene encoding inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase confers resistance to both the purine analogue 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP) and the pyrimidine analogue 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (Carlsson et al., 2013, PLoS One 8, e52094). To find out more about the mechanisms of resistance to nucleotide analogues, and possible interdependencies between purine and pyrimidine analogue resistance mechanisms, we screened a plasmid library in yeast for genes that confer HAP resistance when overexpressed. We cloned four such genes: ADE4, DUT1, APT2, and ATR1. We further looked for genetic interactions between these genes and genes previously found to confer resistance to 5-FU. We found that HMS1, LOG1 (YJL055W), HAM1, and ATR1 confer resistance to both 5-FU and HAP, whereas ADE4, DUT1 and APT2 are specific for HAP resistance, and CPA1 and CPA2 specific for 5-FU resistance. Possible mechanisms for 5-FU and HAP detoxification are discussed based on the observed genetic interactions. Based on the effect of LOG1 against both 5-FU and HAP toxicity, we propose that the original function of the LOG (LONELY GUY) family of proteins likely was to degrade non-canonical nucleotides, and that their role in cytokinin production is a later development in some organisms.",2018-08-06,"Adenine, Antimetabolites, Cloning, Molecular, Drug Resistance, Fungal, Fluorouracil, Fungal Proteins, Gene Dosage, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Gene Knockout Techniques, Genes, Fungal, Inactivation, Metabolic, Purines, Pyrimidines, Recombinant Proteins, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins, Substrate Specificity",PLoS One,,Carlsson

Up till now, the patient's prognosis remains poor which, among others, is due to the paucity of reliable early diagnostic biomarkers. In the past, candidate diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets have been delineated from genes that were found to be differentially expressed in normal versus tumour samples.

The haploid genomes of multiple species of ixodid ticks exceed 1 Gbp, prompting questions regarding gene, segmental and whole genome duplication in this phyletic group. The availability of the genome assembly for the black legged tick, Ixodes scapularis, and transcriptome datasets for multiple species of ticks offers an opportunity to assess the contribution of gene duplication to the genome. Here we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify and analyze duplicated genes (paralogs) using gene models from the prostriate tick, I. scapularis IscaW1.1 annotation and expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from I. scapularis and the metastriate ticks, Rhipicephalus microplus (southern cattle tick), R. appendiculatus (brown ear tick) and Amblyomma variegatum (tropical bont tick).",2016-11-03,"Animals, Evolution, Molecular, Expressed Sequence Tags, Gene Duplication, Ixodidae, Selection, Genetic",BMC Genomics,,Van Zee

The gene expression profiles of GSE32448, GSE45016, GSE46602 and GSE104749 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between prostate cancer and normal samples were identified by R language. The gene ontology functional and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed by the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery software followed by the construction of protein-protein interaction network. Hub gene identification was performed by the plug-in cytoHubba in Cytoscape software. The 217 DEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes including epithelial cell differentiation, response to estradiol and several pathways, mainly associated with protein digestion and absorption pathway in prostate cancer. Epithelial cell adhesion molecule, twist family basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor 1, CD38 molecule and vascular endothelial growth factor A were identified as hub genes.

In this study, we treated rat ovary granulosa cells with dexamethasone to synchronize circadian oscillation in vitro and determined expression levels of Bmal1 and Per2 and six candidate reference genes (Actb, Beta actin; B2m, Beta-2-microglobulin; Ppia, Cyclophilin A; Gapdh, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; Hprt, Hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase and Tbp, TATA-box-binding protein) using quantitative real-time PCR. We then employed three software programs, GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, to analyze the expression data for the selection of the best reference gene. According to GeNorm, Tbp and B2m were assessed as the most stable reference genes; Tbp and Hprt were best by NormFinder and BestKeeper, respectively.

30303517,Association of breast cancer risk with polymorphisms in genes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics and interaction with tobacco smoking: A gene-set analysis.,"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in xenobiotics metabolism (XM) are suspected to play a role in breast cancer risk. However, previous findings based on a SNP by SNP approach need to be replicated taking into account the combined effects of multiple SNPs. We used a gene-set analysis method to study the association between breast cancer risk and genetic variation in XM genes (seen as a set of SNPs) and in the XM pathway (seen as a set of genes). We also studied the interaction between variants in XM genes and tobacco smoking. The analysis was conducted in a case-control study of 1,125 cases and 1,172 controls. Using a dedicated chip, genotyping data of 585 SNPs in 68 XM genes were available. Genetic variation in the whole XM pathway was significantly associated with premenopausal breast cancer risk (p = 0.008). This association was mainly driven by genetic variation in NAT2, CYP2C18, CYP2C19, AKR1C2 and ALDH1A3. The association between the XM gene pathway and breast cancer was observed among current and previous smokers, but not among never smokers (p = 0.013 for interaction between XM genes and tobacco smoking status). The association with breast cancer risk indicates that XM genes variants may play a role in breast carcinogenesis through their detoxification function of environmental pollutants, such as those contained in tobacco smoke.",2019-07-09,"Adult, Aged, Breast Neoplasms, Carcinogenesis, Case-Control Studies, Female, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Humans, Incidence, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Middle Aged, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Risk Factors, Smoke, Tobacco, Tobacco Smoking, Xenobiotics",Int J Cancer,10.1002/ijc.31917,Berrandou
30529285,Reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression in wood-decomposing fungi.,"Wood-decomposing fungi efficiently decompose plant lignocellulose, and there is increasing interest in characterizing and perhaps harnessing the fungal gene regulation strategies that enable wood decomposition. Proper interpretation of these fungal mechanisms relies on accurate quantification of gene expression, demanding reliable internal control genes (ICGs) as references. Commonly used ICGs such as actin, however, fluctuate among wood-decomposing fungi under defined conditions. In this study, by mining RNA-seq data in silico and validating ICGs in vitro using qRT-PCR, we targeted more reliable ICGs for studying transcriptional responses in wood-decomposing fungi, particularly responses to changing environments (e.g., carbon sources, decomposition stages) in various culture conditions. Using the model brown rot fungus Postia placenta in a first-pass study, our mining efforts yielded 15 constitutively-expressed genes robust in variable carbon sources (e.g., no carbon, glucose, cellobiose, aspen) and cultivation stages (e.g., 15 h, 72 h) in submerged cultures. Of these, we found 7 genes as most suitable ICGs. Expression stabilities of these newly selected ICGs were better than commonly used ICGs, analyzed by NormFinder algorithm and qRT-PCR. In a second-pass, multi-species study in solid wood, our RNA-seq mining efforts revealed hundreds of highly constitutively expressed genes among four wood-decomposing fungi with varying nutritional modes (brown rot, white rot), including a shared core set of ICGs numbering 11 genes. Together, the newly selected ICGs highlighted here will increase reliability when studying gene regulatory mechanisms of wood-decomposing fungi.",2019-06-24,"Fungi, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Lignin, Wood",Fungal Genet Biol,10.1016/j.fgb.2018.11.005,Zhang

27940565,Differentially expressed genes and gene networks involved in pig ovarian follicular atresia.,"Ovarian folliculogenesis corresponds to the development of follicles leading to either ovulation or degeneration, this latter process being called atresia. Even if atresia involves apoptosis, its mechanism is not well understood. The objective of this study was to analyze global gene expression in pig granulosa cells of ovarian follicles during atresia. The transcriptome analysis was performed on a 9,216 cDNA microarray to identify gene networks and candidate genes involved in pig ovarian follicular atresia. We found 1,684 significantly regulated genes to be differentially regulated between small healthy follicles and small atretic follicles. Among them, 287 genes had a fold-change higher than two between the two follicle groups. Eleven genes (DKK3, GADD45A, CAMTA2, CCDC80, DAPK2, ECSIT, MSMB, NUPR1, RUNX2, SAMD4A, and ZNF628) having a fold-change higher than five between groups could likely serve as markers of follicular atresia. Moreover, automatic confrontation of deregulated genes with literature data highlighted 93 genes as regulatory candidates of pig granulosa cell atresia. Among these genes known to be inhibitors of apoptosis, stimulators of apoptosis, or tumor suppressors INHBB, HNF4, CLU, different interleukins (IL5, IL24), TNF-associated receptor (TNFR1), and cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) were suggested as playing an important role in porcine atresia. The present study also enlists key upstream regulators in follicle atresia based on our results and on a literature review. The novel gene candidates and gene networks identified in the current study lead to a better understanding of the molecular regulation of ovarian follicular atresia.",2018-02-09,"Animals, Apoptosis, Biomarkers, Cluster Analysis, Down-Regulation, Female, Follicular Atresia, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Ovarian Follicle, Signal Transduction, Sus scrofa, Up-Regulation",Physiol Genomics,10.1152/physiolgenomics.00069.2016,Terenina

Enteritidis) is the most common cause of egg borne salmonellosis in many parts of the world. This study analyzed gene expression of this bacterium during growth in whole egg, and whether highly expressed genes were essential for the growth. High quality RNA was extracted from S. Enteritidis using a modified RNA-extraction protocol. Global gene expression during growth in whole egg was compared to growth in LB-medium using DNA array method. Twenty-six genes were significantly upregulated during growth in egg; these belonged to amino acid biosynthesis, di/oligopeptide transport system, biotin synthesis, ferrous iron transport system, and type III secretion system. Significant downregulation of 15 genes related to formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) and trehalose metabolism was observed. The results suggested that S. Enteritidis is starved for amino-acids, biotin and iron when growing in egg. However, site specific mutation of amino acid biosynthesis genes asnA (17.3 fold upregulated), asnB (18.6 fold upregulated), asnA/asnB and, serA (12.0 fold upregulated) and gdhA (3.7 fold upregulated), did not result in growth attenuation, suggesting that biosynthesis using the enzymes encoded from these genes may represent the first choice for S. Enteritidis when growing in egg, but when absent, the bacterium could use alternative ways to obtain the amino acids.

24638931,"Identification of housekeeping genes suitable for gene expression analysis in the pearl mussel, Hyriopsis cumingii, during biomineralization.","Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction is a sensitive technique for quantifying gene expression levels. One or more appropriate reference genes must be selected to accurately compare mRNA transcript levels across different samples and tissues. The freshwater pearl, Hyriopsis cumingii (Lea), is an important economic species cultured in China. To date, no reference genes for gene expression analysis in this species have been validated. This study aimed to compare the relative expression of seven housekeeping genes across different tissue types and in the mantle or pearl sac during three biomineralization processes: seasonal shell growth, shell healing and pearl-sac formation in H. cumingii. Three programs evaluated the expression stabilities of the seven genes: BestKeeper, geNorm and NormFinder. The beta actin gene (ACTB), commonly used as a housekeeping gene in many studies, was the least stable. The expressions of Ubiquitin (Ubi) and Ribosomal protein L18 (Rpl18) and Elongation factor 1-alpha (EF1α) were more stable than the remaining four genes. Therefore, we suggest that Ubi, Rpl18 and EF1α are suitable reference genes.

25198343,RNAi pathway genes are resistant to small RNA mediated gene silencing in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.,"The RNA interference pathway in the protist Entamoeba histolytica plays important roles in permanent gene silencing as well as in the regulation of virulence determinants. Recently, a novel RNA interference (RNAi)-based silencing technique was developed in this parasite that uses a gene endogenously silenced by small RNAs as a ""trigger"" to induce silencing of other genes that are fused to it. Fusion to a trigger gene induces the production of gene-specific antisense small RNAs, resulting in robust and permanent silencing of the cognate gene. This approach has silenced multiple genes including those involved in virulence and transcriptional regulation. We now demonstrate that all tested genes of the amebic RNAi pathway are unable to be silenced using the trigger approach, including Argonaute genes (Ago2-1, Ago2-2, and Ago2-3), RNaseIII, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP). In all situations (except for RdRP), fusion to a trigger successfully induces production of gene-specific antisense small RNAs to the cognate gene. These small RNAs are capable of silencing a target gene in trans, indicating that they are functional; despite this, however, they cannot silence the RNAi pathway genes. Interestingly, when a trigger is fused to RdRP, small RNA induction to RdRP does not occur, a unique phenotype hinting that either RdRP is highly resistant to being a target of small RNAs or that small RNA generation may be controlled by RdRP. The inability of the small RNA pathway to silence RNAi genes in E. histolytica, despite the generation of functional small RNAs to these loci suggest that epigenetic factors may protect certain genomic loci and thus determine susceptibility to small RNA mediated silencing.

31115762,Global transcriptome analysis uncovers the gene co-expression regulation network and key genes involved in grain development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.).,"Wheat grain development is a robust biological process that largely determines grain quality and yield. In this study, we investigated the grain transcriptome of winter wheat cv. Xiaoyan-6 at four developmental stages (5, 10, 15, and 20 days post-anthesis), using high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). We identified 427 grain-specific transcription factors (TFs) and 1653 differentially expressed TFs during grain development as well as a grain co-expression regulation network (GrainNet) of the TFs and their predicted co-expressed genes. Our study identified ten putative key TFs and the predicted regulatory genes of these TFs in wheat grain development of Xiaoyan-6. The analysis was given a firm basis through the study of additional wheat tissues, including root, stem, leaf, flag leaf, grain, spikes (from wheat plants at booting or heading stages) to provide a dataset of 92,478 high-confidence protein-coding genes that were mostly evenly distributed among subgenomes, but unevenly distributed across each of the chromosomes or each of the seven homeologous groups. Within this larger framework of the transcriptomes, we identified 4659 grain-specific genes (SEGs) and 26,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) throughout grain development stages tested. The SEGs identified mainly associate with regulation and signaling-related biological processes, while the DEGs mainly involve in cellular component organization or biogenesis and nutrient reservoir activity during grain development of Xiaoyan-6.

Selection of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is an elementary prerequisite for reliable measurements of gene expression levels. Here, by analyzing datasets published between 2008 and 2017, we summarized the current trends in reference gene selection for insect gene expression studies that employed the most widely used SYBR Green method for RT-qPCR normalization. We curated 90 representative papers, mainly published in 2013-2017, in which a total of 78 insect species were investigated in 100 experiments. Furthermore, top five journals, top 10 frequently used reference genes, and top 10 experimental factors have been determined. The relationships between the numbers of the reference genes, experimental factors, analysis tools on the one hand and publication date (year) on the other hand was investigated by linear regression. We found that the more recently the paper was published, the more experimental factors it tended to explore, and more analysis tools it used. However, linear regression analysis did not reveal a significant correlation between the number of reference genes and the study publication date. Taken together, this meta-analysis will be of great help to researchers that plan gene expression studies in insects, especially the non-model ones, as it provides a summary of appropriate reference genes for expression studies, considers the optimal number of reference genes, and reviews the average number of experimental factors and analysis tools per study.",,,Front Physiol,,Lü
29286093,Identifying hub genes and potential mechanisms associated with senescence in human annulus cells by gene expression profiling and bioinformatics analysis.,"The aim of the present study was to reveal the potential hub genes and regulatory mechanisms associated with senescence in human annulus cells by analyzing microarray data using bioinformatics. The gene expression dataset GSE17077, of senescent and non‑senescent annulus cells obtained from patients with disc degenerative diseases (DDD), was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Functional and pathway annotations were performed using Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes terms, respectively. Web‑based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit and Chip Enrichment Analysis were used to identify key transcription factors (TFs). A protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to analyze the hub genes associated with senescence in DDD. A total of 667 DEGs were screened, including 368 up‑ and 299 down‑regulated genes. These DEGs were enriched in phosphorylation, regulation of apoptosis and regulation of programmed cell death. In addition, DEGs were involved in axon guidance, natural killer cell‑mediated cytotoxicity, purine metabolism and the mitogen‑activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. The TFs activator protein 1 (AP1), specificity protein 1 and aryl hydrocarbon receptor may serve regulatory roles in gene expression in senescent cells. Certain key target genes of TFs, including heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and C‑X‑C motif chemokine 5 (CXCL5), within the DEGs were revealed to have a high connectivity degree by PPI analysis.

The expression of these genes was determined using five programs-geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, ΔCt, and RefFinder. The results showed that α-TUB2 (alpha-tubulin 2) and DnaJ (chaperone protein DnaJ 49) were the most stable reference genes across all the tested samples. We measured the expression profiles of the defense response gene SmCAT (catalase) using the two most stable and one least stable reference genes in all samples of S. matsudana. The relative quantification of SmCAT varied greatly according to the different reference genes. We propose that α-TUB2 and DnaJ should be the preferred reference genes for normalization and quantification of transcript levels in future gene expression studies in willow species under various abiotic stress conditions.",2018-10-15,"Algorithms, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Reproducibility of Results, Salix, Stress, Physiological",Sci Rep,,Zhang
26313945,Identification and Evaluation of Reference Genes for Quantitative Analysis of Brazilian Pine (Araucaria angustifolia Bertol.

In this study, we identified fifteen putative reference genes from an A. angustifolia transcriptome database. Variation in transcript levels was first evaluated in silico by comparing read counts and then by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), resulting in the identification of six candidate genes. The consistency of transcript abundance was also calculated applying geNorm and NormFinder software packages followed by a validation approach using four target genes. The results presented here indicate that a diverse set of samples should ideally be used in order to identify constitutively expressed genes, and that the use of any two reference genes in combination, of the six tested genes, is sufficient for effective expression normalization. Finally, in agreement with the in silico prediction, a comprehensive analysis of the qRT-PCR data combined with validation analysis revealed that AaEIF4B-L and AaPP2A are the most suitable reference genes for comparative studies of A. angustifolia gene expression.

29031031,RiceAntherNet: a gene co-expression network for identifying anther and pollen development genes.,"In plants, normal anther and pollen development involves many important biological events and complex molecular regulatory coordination. Understanding gene regulatory relationships during male reproductive development is essential for fundamental biology and crop breeding. In this work, we developed a rice gene co-expression network for anther development (RiceAntherNet) that allows prediction of gene regulatory relationships during pollen development. RiceAntherNet was generated from 57 rice anther tissue microarrays across all developmental stages. The microarray datasets from nine rice male sterile mutants, including msp1-4, ostdl1a, gamyb-2, tip2, udt1-1, tdr, eat1-1, ptc1 and mads3-4, were used to explore and test the network. Among the changed genes, three clades showing differential expression patterns were constructed to identify genes associated with pollen formation. Many of these have known roles in pollen development, for example, seven genes in Clade 1 (OsABCG15, OsLAP5, OsLAP6, DPW, CYP703A3, OsNP1 and OsCP1) are involved in rice pollen wall formation. Furthermore, Clade 1 contained 12 genes whose predicted orthologs in Arabidopsis have been reported as key during pollen development and may play similar roles in rice. Genes in Clade 2 are expressed earlier than Clade 1 (anther stages 2-9), while genes in Clade 3 are expressed later (stages 10-12). RiceAntherNet serves as a valuable tool for identifying novel genes during plant anther and pollen development.

24675788,Identification of internal reference genes for gene expression normalization between the two sexes in dioecious white Campion.,"Quantitative real time (qRT)-PCR is a precise and efficient method for studying gene expression changes between two states of interest, and is frequently used for validating interesting gene expression patterns in candidate genes initially identified in genome-wide expression analyses, such as RNA-seq experiments. For an adequate normalisation of qRT-PCR data, it is essential to have reference genes available whose expression intensities are constant among the different states of interest. In this study we present and validate a catalogue of traditional and newly identified reference genes that were selected from RNA-seq data from multiple individuals from the dioecious plant Silene latifolia with the aim of studying gene expression differences between the two sexes in both reproductive and vegetative tissues. The catalogue contains more than 15 reference genes with both stable expression intensities and a range of expression intensities in flower buds and leaf tissues. These reference genes were used to normalize expression differences between reproductive and vegetative tissues in eight candidate genes with sex-biased expression. Our results suggest a trend towards a reduced sex-bias in sex-linked gene expression in vegetative tissues. In this study, we report on the systematic identification and validation of internal reference genes for adequate normalization of qRT-PCR-based analyses of gene expression differences between the two sexes in S. latifolia. We also show how RNA-seq data can be used efficiently to identify suitable reference genes in a wide diversity of species.

27558666,Head Transcriptomes of Two Closely Related Species of Fruit Flies of the Anastrepha fraterculus Group Reveals Divergent Genes in Species with Extensive Gene Flow.,"Several fruit flies species of the Anastrepha fraterculus group are of great economic importance for the damage they cause to a variety of fleshy fruits. Some species in this group have diverged recently, with evidence of introgression, showing similar morphological attributes that render their identification difficult, reinforcing the relevance of identifying new molecular markers that may differentiate species. We investigated genes expressed in head tissues from two closely related species: A. obliqua and A. fraterculus, aiming to identify fixed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and highly differentiated transcripts, which, considering that these species still experience some level of gene flow, could indicate potential candidate genes involved in their differentiation process. We generated multiple libraries from head tissues of these two species, at different reproductive stages, for both sexes. Our analyses indicate that the de novo transcriptome assemblies are fairly complete. We also produced a hybrid assembly to map each species' reads, and identified 67,470 SNPs in A. fraterculus, 39,252 in A. obliqua, and 6386 that were common to both species. We identified 164 highly differentiated unigenes that had a mean interspecific index ([Formula: see text]) of at least 0.94. We selected unigenes that had Ka/Ks higher than 0.5, or had at least three or more highly differentiated SNPs as potential candidate genes for species differentiation. Among these candidates, we identified proteases, regulators of redox homeostasis, and an odorant-binding protein (Obp99c), among other genes. The head transcriptomes described here enabled the identification of thousands of genes hitherto unavailable for these species, and generated a set of candidate genes that are potentially important to genetically identify species and understand the speciation process in the presence of gene flow of A. obliqua and A. fraterculus.",2017-11-10,"Alleles, Animals, Computational Biology, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Flow, Genes, Insect, Genetic Variation, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Organ Specificity, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Selection, Genetic, Species Specificity, Tephritidae, Transcriptome",G3 (Bethesda),,Rezende
26590211,"Evolutionarily Dynamic, but Robust, Targeting of Resistance Genes by the miR482/2118 Gene Family in the Solanaceae.","Plants are exposed to pathogens around the clock. A common resistance response in plants upon pathogen detection is localized cell death. Given the irreversible nature of this response, multiple layers of negative regulation are present to prevent the untimely or misexpression of resistance genes. One layer of negative regulation is provided by a recently discovered microRNA (miRNA) gene family, miR482/2118. This family targets the transcripts of resistance genes in plants. We investigated the evolutionary history and specificity of this miRNA gene family within the Solanaceae. This plant family includes many important crop species, providing a set of well-defined resistance gene repertoires. Across 14 species from the Solanaceae, we identified eight distinct miR482/2118 gene family members. Our studies show conservation of miRNA type and number in the group of wild tomatoes and, to a lesser extent, throughout the Solanaceae. The eight orthologous miRNA gene clusters evolved under different evolutionary constraints, allowing for individual subfunctionalization of the miRNAs. Despite differences in the predicted targeting behavior of each miRNA, the miRNA-R-gene network is robust due to its high degree of interconnectivity and redundant targeting. Our data suggest that the miR482/2118 gene family acts as an evolutionary buffer for R-gene sequence diversity.

31516570,Identifying prognosis and metastasis-associated genes associated with Ewing sarcoma by weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is a highly malignant pediatric tumor with a low survival rate and a high rate of metastasis. However, there have been limited reports on the exploration of new biomarkers of ES. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify the potential hub genes associated with overall vital survival (OVS) and metastasis in ES. Traditional methods for identifying differentially expressed genes lack the in-depth information of mechanistic studies. In this study, a weighted co-expression network for ES was constructed through weighted gene co-expression network analysis to identify co-expression modules associated with clinical phenotypes. The hub genes in the metastasis- and OVS-related co-expression modules were extracted, and the association between the hub genes and patient OVS was verified in another independent Gene Expression Omnibus dataset. Functional annotations and protein-protein interaction analysis of co-expression modules were also used to understand the potential regulatory mechanisms. The results of the functional enrichment analysis revealed that the OVS-associated module was mainly enriched in the cell cycle and immune response, and the metastasis-associated module was enriched in metabolism. A total of four genes (proteasome subunit α4, L1 cell adhesion molecule, serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) in the OVS-related module and two genes (calcium voltage-gated channel auxiliary subunit γ2 and γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor subunit 2) in the metastasis-related module were selected as hub genes. Further research on the hub genes identified in the present study may contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of ES metastasis and progression.",,,Oncol Lett,,Wang
31957802,Cell-to-Cell Variation in Gene Expression for Cultured Human Cells is Controlled in Trans by Diverse Genes: Implications for the Pathobiology of Aging.,"Cell-to-cell variation in gene expression increases among homologous cells within multiple tissues during aging. We call this phenomenon variegated gene expression (VGE). Long, healthy life requires robust and coordinated gene expression. We posit that nature may have evolved VGE as a bet-hedging mechanism to protect reproductively active populations. The price we may pay is accelerated aging. That hypothesis will require the demonstration that genetic loci are capable of modulating degrees of VGE. While loci controlling VGE in yeast and genes controlling inter-individual variation in gene expression in C. elegans have been identified, there has been no compelling evidence for the role of specific genetic loci in modulations of VGE of specific targets in humans. With the assistance of a core facility, we used a customized library of siRNA constructs to screen 1,195 human genes to identify loci contributing to the control of VGE of a gene with relevance to the biology of aging. We identified approximately 50 loci controlling VGE of the prolongevity gene, SIRT1. Because of its partial homology to FOXO3A, a variant of which is enriched in centenarians, our lab independently confirmed that the knockdown of FOXF2 greatly diminished VGE of SIRT1 but had little impact upon the VGE of WRN. While the role of these VGE-altering genes on aging in vivo remains to be determined, we hypothesize that some of these genes can be targeted to increase functionality during aging.",,,J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,10.1093/gerona/glaa027,Zhang

27090961,Transcriptome analysis of genes and gene networks involved in aggressive behavior in mouse and zebrafish.,"Despite moderate heritability estimates, the molecular architecture of aggressive behavior remains poorly characterized. This study compared gene expression profiles from a genetic mouse model of aggression with zebrafish, an animal model traditionally used to study aggression. A meta-analytic, cross-species approach was used to identify genomic variants associated with aggressive behavior. The Rankprod algorithm was used to evaluated mRNA differences from prefrontal cortex tissues of three sets of mouse lines (N = 18) selectively bred for low and high aggressive behavior (SAL/LAL, TA/TNA, and NC900/NC100). The same approach was used to evaluate mRNA differences in zebrafish (N = 12) exposed to aggressive or non-aggressive social encounters. Results were compared to uncover genes consistently implicated in aggression across both studies. Seventy-six genes were differentially expressed (PFP < 0.05) in aggressive compared to non-aggressive mice. Seventy genes were differentially expressed in zebrafish exposed to a fight encounter compared to isolated zebrafish. Seven genes (Fos, Dusp1, Hdac4, Ier2, Bdnf, Btg2, and Nr4a1) were differentially expressed across both species 5 of which belonging to a gene-network centred on the c-Fos gene hub. Network analysis revealed an association with the MAPK signaling cascade. In human studies HDAC4 haploinsufficiency is a key genetic mechanism associated with brachydactyly mental retardation syndrome (BDMR), which is associated with aggressive behaviors. Moreover, the HDAC4 receptor is a drug target for valproic acid, which is being employed as an effective pharmacological treatment for aggressive behavior in geriatric, psychiatric, and brain-injury patients. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2017-09-21,"Aggression, Animals, Behavior, Animal, Disease Models, Animal, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, fos, Mice, Social Behavior, Transcriptome, Zebrafish",Am J Med Genet B Neuropsychiatr Genet,10.1002/ajmg.b.32451,Malki
25047803,Genome duplication and gene loss affect the evolution of heat shock transcription factor genes in legumes.,"Whole-genome duplication events (polyploidy events) and gene loss events have played important roles in the evolution of legumes. Here we show that the vast majority of Hsf gene duplications resulted from whole genome duplication events rather than tandem duplication, and significant differences in gene retention exist between species. By searching for intraspecies gene colinearity (microsynteny) and dating the age distributions of duplicated genes, we found that genome duplications accounted for 42 of 46 Hsf-containing segments in Glycine max, while paired segments were rarely identified in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan. However, by comparing interspecies microsynteny, we determined that the great majority of Hsf-containing segments in Lotus japonicas, Medicago truncatula and Cajanus cajan show extensive conservation with the duplicated regions of Glycine max. These segments formed 17 groups of orthologous segments. These results suggest that these regions shared ancient genome duplication with Hsf genes in Glycine max, but more than half of the copies of these genes were lost. On the other hand, the Glycine max Hsf gene family retained approximately 75% and 84% of duplicated genes produced from the ancient genome duplication and recent Glycine-specific genome duplication, respectively. Continuous purifying selection has played a key role in the maintenance of Hsf genes in Glycine max. Expression analysis of the Hsf genes in Lotus japonicus revealed their putative involvement in multiple tissue-/developmental stages and responses to various abiotic stimuli. This study traces the evolution of Hsf genes in legume species and demonstrates that the rates of gene gain and loss are far from equilibrium in different species.

30837616,Selection of suitable reference genes for gene expression analysis in gills and liver of fish under field pollution conditions.,"To understand the role of gene expression in adaptive variation, it is necessary to examine expression variation in an ecological context. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is considered the most accurate and reliable technique to measure gene expression and to validate the data obtained by RNA-seq; however, accurate normalization is crucial. In Chile, the freshwater silverside fish Basilichthys microlepidotus inhabits both polluted and nonpolluted areas, showing differential gene expression related to pollution. In this study, we infer the stability of six potential reference genes (tubulin alpha, hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-actin, 60S ribosomal protein L13, and 60S ribosomal protein L8) in the gills and liver of silverside individuals inhabiting polluted and nonpolluted areas. To validate the reference genes selected, the most and least stable reference genes were used to normalize two target transcripts, one for each organ. The RefFinder tool was used to analyze and identify the most stably expressed genes. The 60S ribosomal protein L8 gene was ranked as the most stable gene for both organs. Our results show that reference gene selection influences the detection of differences in the expression levels of target genes in different organs and, also highlighting candidate reference genes that could be used in field studies.",,,Sci Rep,,Rojas-Hernandez

31349573,"The Gene Master Regulators (GMR) Approach Provides Legitimate Targets for Personalized, Time-Sensitive Cancer Gene Therapy.","The dynamic and never exactly repeatable tumor transcriptomic profile of people affected by the same form of cancer requires a personalized and time-sensitive approach of the gene therapy. The Gene Master Regulators (GMRs) were defined as genes whose highly controlled expression by the homeostatic mechanisms commands the cell phenotype by modulating major functional pathways through expression correlation with their genes. The Gene Commanding Height (GCH), a measure that combines the expression control and expression correlation with all other genes, is used to establish the gene hierarchy in each cell phenotype. We developed the experimental protocol, the mathematical algorithm and the computer software to identify the GMRs from transcriptomic data in surgically removed tumors, biopsies or blood from cancer patients. The GMR approach is illustrated with applications to our microarray data on human kidney, thyroid and prostate cancer samples, and on thyroid, prostate and blood cancer cell lines. We proved experimentally that each patient has his/her own GMRs, that cancer nuclei and surrounding normal tissue are governed by different GMRs, and that manipulating the expression has larger consequences for genes with higher GCH. Therefore, we launch the hypothesis that silencing the GMR may selectively kill the cancer cells from a tissue.",2020-01-09,"Aged, Cell Line, Tumor, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Regulator, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms, Male, Models, Theoretical, Precision Medicine, Prostatic Neoplasms, Software, Thyroid Neoplasms",Genes (Basel),,Iacobas

This study aimed to elucidate potential candidate hub genes and key pathways related to BD in a pre-frontal cortex sample. Raw gene expression profile files of GSE53987, including 36 samples, were obtained from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database. After data pre-processing, 10,094 genes were selected for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). After dividing highly related genes into 19 modules, we found that the pink, midnight blue, and brown modules were highly correlated with BD. Functional annotation and pathway enrichment analysis for modules, which indicated some key pathways, were conducted based on the Enrichr database. One of the most remarkable significant pathways is the Hippo signaling pathway and its positive transcriptional regulation. Finally, 30 hub genes were identified in three modules. Hub genes with a high degree of connectivity in the PPI network are significantly enriched in positive regulation of transcription. In addition, the hub genes were validated based on another dataset (GSE12649).

In the ""post-genomic"" era, a need is emerging to elucidate the physiologic functions of myocardial genes, as well as potential adaptive and maladaptive modulations induced by environmental/epigenetic factors. Genome sequencing and analysis advances have become exponential lately, with escalation of our knowledge concerning sometimes controversial genetic underpinnings of cardiovascular diseases. Current technologies can identify candidate genes variously involved in diverse normal/abnormal morphomechanical phenotypes, and offer insights into multiple genetic factors implicated in complex cardiovascular syndromes. The expression profiles of thousands of genes are regularly ascertained under diverse conditions. Global analyses of gene expression levels are useful for cataloging genes and correlated phenotypes, and for elucidating the role of genes in maladies. Comparative expression of gene networks coupled to complex disorders can contribute insights as to how ""modifier genes"" influence the expressed phenotypes. Increasingly, a more comprehensive and detailed systematic understanding of genetic abnormalities underlying, for example, various genetic cardiomyopathies is emerging. Implementing genomic findings in cardiology practice may well lead directly to better diagnosing and therapeutics. There is currently evolving a strong appreciation for the value of studying gene anomalies, and doing so in a non-disjointed, cohesive manner.

30626157,A Novel Method for Identifying Essential Genes by Fusing Dynamic Protein⁻Protein Interactive Networks.,"Essential genes play an indispensable role in supporting the life of an organism. Identification of essential genes helps us to understand the underlying mechanism of cell life. The essential genes of bacteria are potential drug targets of some diseases genes. Recently, several computational methods have been proposed to detect essential genes based on the static protein⁻protein interactive (PPI) networks. However, these methods have ignored the fact that essential genes play essential roles under certain conditions. In this work, a novel method was proposed for the identification of essential proteins by fusing the dynamic PPI networks of different time points (called by FDP). Firstly, the active PPI networks of each time point were constructed and then they were fused into a final network according to the networks' similarities. Finally, a novel centrality method was designed to assign each gene in the final network a ranking score, whilst considering its orthologous property and its global and local topological properties in the network. This model was applied on two different yeast data sets. The results showed that the FDP achieved a better performance in essential gene prediction as compared to other existing methods that are based on the static PPI network or that are based on dynamic networks.",2019-11-06,"Genes, Essential, Protein Interaction Mapping, Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Genes (Basel),,Zhang

The selection of appropriate internal reference genes is very important to accurately determine target gene expression via quantitative real-time PCR. However, internal reference gene selection has never been conducted in B. semperflorens. In this study, seven candidate reference genes of B. semperflorens, including 18S ribosomal RNA (Bs18S), pentatricopeptide repeat-containing protein (BsPPR), actin-related protein 5 isoform X2 (BsACT), DNAJ homologue subfamily C member 17 (BsDNAJ), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BsGAPDH), NAD-dependent malic enzyme 59 kDa isoform, mitochondria (BsNAD-ME), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase CYP26-2, chloroplast (BsCYP), which were obtained from our previous studies, were selected.

Of the seven candidate reference genes, the combination of BsACT, BsDNAJ, and BsNAD-ME was the ideal reference gene set for normalising gene expression in samples under biotic conditions. BsCYP combined with BsACT or BsGAPDH was the best reference gene pair under abiotic conditions. BsACT and BsPPR could be combined to normalise gene expression under low temperature.

24567495,Members of the barley NAC transcription factor gene family show differential co-regulation with senescence-associated genes during senescence of flag leaves.,"The senescence process of plants is important for the completion of their life cycle, particularly for crop plants, it is essential for efficient nutrient remobilization during seed filling. It is a highly regulated process, and in order to address the regulatory aspect, the role of genes in the NAC transcription factor family during senescence of barley flag leaves was studied. Several members of the NAC transcription factor gene family were up-regulated during senescence in a microarray experiment, together with a large range of senescence-associated genes, reflecting the coordinated activation of degradation processes in senescing barley leaf tissues. This picture was confirmed in a detailed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) experiment, which also showed distinct gene expression patterns for different members of the NAC gene family, suggesting a group of ~15 out of the 47 studied NAC genes to be important for signalling processes and for the execution of degradation processes during leaf senescence in barley. Seven models for DNA-binding motifs for NAC transcription factors were designed based on published motifs, and available promoter sequences of barley genes were screened for the motifs. Genes up-regulated during senescence showed a significant over-representation of the motifs, suggesting regulation by the NAC transcription factors. Furthermore, co-regulation studies showed that genes possessing the motifs in the promoter in general were highly co-expressed with members of the NAC gene family. In conclusion, a list of up to 15 NAC genes from barley that are strong candidates for being regulatory factors of importance for senescence and biotic stress-related traits affecting the productivity of cereal crop plants has been generated. Furthermore, a list of 71 senescence-associated genes that are potential target genes for these NAC transcription factors is presented.

29425824,Salt and drought stress and ABA responses related to bZIP genes from V. radiata and V. angularis.,"Mung bean and adzuki bean are warm-season legumes widely cultivated in China. However, bean production in major producing regions is limited by biotic and abiotic stress, such as drought and salt stress. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) genes play key roles in responses to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, only several bZIP genes involved in drought and salt stress in legumes, especially Vigna radiata and Vigna angularis, have been identified. In this study, we identified 54 and 50 bZIP proteins from whole-genome sequences of V. radiata and V. angularis, respectively. First, we comprehensively surveyed the characteristics of all bZIP genes, including their gene structure, chromosome distribution and motif composition. Phylogenetic trees showed that VrbZIP and VabZIP proteins were divided into ten clades comprising nine known and one unknown subgroup. The results of the nucleotide substitution rate of the orthologous gene pairs showed that bZIP proteins have undergone strong purifying selection: V. radiata and V. angularis diverged 1.25 million years ago (mya) to 9.20 mya (average of 4.95 mya). We also found that many cis-acting regulatory elements (CAREs) involved in abiotic stress and plant hormone responses were detected in the putative promoter regions of the bZIP genes. Finally, using the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) method, we performed expression profiling of the bZIP genes in response to drought, salt and abscisic acid (ABA). We identified several bZIP genes that may be involved in drought and salt responses. Generally, our results provided useful and rich resources of VrbZIP and VabZIP genes for the functional characterization and understanding of bZIP transcription factors (TFs) in warm-season legumes. In addition, our results revealed important and interesting data - a subset of VrbZIP and VabZIP gene expression profiles in response to drought, salt and ABA stress. These results provide gene expression evidence for the selection of candidate genes under drought and salt stress for future study.",2018-03-09,"Abscisic Acid, Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors, Droughts, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Plant, Genome, Plant, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Sodium Chloride, Stress, Physiological, Vigna",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.02.005,Wang

22868207,Phylogenetic relationships of the Cobitoidea (Teleostei: Cypriniformes) inferred from mitochondrial and nuclear genes with analyses of gene evolution.,"The superfamily Cobitoidea of the order Cypriniformes is a diverse group of fishes, inhabiting freshwater ecosystems across Eurasia and North Africa. The phylogenetic relationships of this well-corroborated natural group and diverse clade are critical to not only informing scientific communities of the phylogeny of the order Cypriniformes, the world's largest freshwater fish order, but are key to every area of comparative biology examining the evolution of traits, functional structures, and breeding behaviors to their biogeographic histories, speciation, anagenetic divergence, and divergence time estimates. In the present study, two mitochondrial gene sequences (COI, ND4+5) and four single-copy nuclear gene segments (RH1, RAG1, EGR2B, IRBP) were used to infer the phylogenetic relationships of the Cobitoidea as reconstructed from maximum likelihood (ML) and partitioned Bayesian Analysis (BA). Analyses of the combined mitochondrial/nuclear gene datasets revealed five strongly supported monophyletic Cobitoidea families and their sister-group relationships: Botiidae+(Vaillantellidae+(Cobitidae+(Nemacheilidae+Balitoridae))). These recovered relationships are in agreement with previous systematic studies on the order Cypriniformes and/or those focusing on the superfamily Cobitoidea. Using these relationships, our analyses revealed pattern lineage- or ecological-group-specific evolution of these genes for the Cobitoidea. These observations and results corroborate the hypothesis that these group-specific-ancestral ecological characters have contributed in the diversification and/or adaptations within these groups. Positive selections were detected in RH1 of nemacheilids and in RAG1 of nemacheilids and genus Vaillantella, which indicated that evolution of RH1 (related to eye's optic sense) and RAG1 (related to immunity) genes appeared to be important for the diversification of these groups. The balitorid lineage (those species inhabiting fast-flowing riverine habitats) had, as compared with other cobitoid lineages, significantly different dN/dS, dN and dS values for ND4 and IRBP genes. These significant differences are usually indicative of weaker selection pressure, and lineage-specific evolution on genes along the balitorid lineage. Furthermore, within Cobitoidea, excluding balitorids, species living in subtropics had significantly higher dN/dS values in RAG1 and IRBP genes than those living in temperate and tropical zones. Among tropical cobitoids, genes COI, ND5, EGR2B, IRBP and RH1, had a significantly higher mean dS value than those species in subtropical and temperate groups. These findings suggest that the evolution of these genes could also be ecological-group-specific and may have played an important role in the adaptive evolution and diversification of these groups. Thus, we hypothesize that the genes included in the present study were actively involved in lineage- and/or ecological-group-specific evolutionary processes of the highly diverse Cobitoidea. These two evolutionary patterns, both subject to further testing, are hypothesized as integral in the diversification with this major clade of the world's most diverse group of freshwater fishes.",2012-11-08,"Animals, Bayes Theorem, Biological Evolution, Cypriniformes, Genes, Mitochondrial, Nuclear Proteins, Phylogeny",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2012.07.040,Liu
31306099,Identification of hub genes in prostate cancer using robust rank aggregation and weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"The pathogenic mechanisms of prostate cancer (PCa) remain to be defined. In this study, we utilized the Robust Rank Aggregation (RRA) method to integrate 10 eligible PCa microarray datasets from the GEO and identified a set of significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between tumor samples and normal, matched specimens. To explore potential associations between gene sets and PCa clinical features and to identify hub genes, we utilized WGCNA to construct gene co-expression networks incorporating the DEGs screened with the use of RRA. From the key module, we selected LMNB1, TK1, ZWINT, and RACGAP1 for validation. We found that these genes were up-regulated in PCa samples, and higher expression levels were associated with higher Gleason scores and tumor grades. Moreover, ROC and K-M plots indicated these genes had good diagnostic and prognostic value for PCa. On the other hand, methylation analyses suggested that the abnormal up-regulation of these four genes likely resulted from hypomethylation, while GSEA and GSVA for single hub gene revealed they all had a close association with proliferation of PCa cells. These findings provide new insight into PCa pathogenesis, and identify LMNB1, TK1, RACGAP1 and ZWINT as candidate biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of PCa.",,,Aging (Albany NY),,Song
28371410,New genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis identified by gene expression profiling.,"In this study, we aimed to find new genes associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) so that more comprehensive genes would be used for monitoring and/or diagnosing patients. Illumina digital gene expression profiling was applied in two sample types - peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and synovial cells to compare the gene expression pattern between 17 patients with RA and three control groups (six osteoarthritis patients, three ankylosing spondylitis patients and 17 healthy controls). Bioinformatics was performed on pathway analysis and protein-protein interaction networks. Four novel genes from PBMCs - DHRS3, TTC38, SAP30BP and LPIN2 - were found to be associated with RA and further confirmed through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Five new differentially expressed genes (EPYC, LIFR, GLDN, TADA3 and ZNRF3) found in synovial cells were not confirmed. Pathway analyses revealed 10 significantly enriched pathways, and a protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that four novel PBMC-derived genes were connected to previously reported genes by four intermediate genes. Therefore, we proposed that four newly identified PBMC-derived genes could be integrated with previously reported RA-associated genes to monitor and/or diagnose RA.",2017-12-11,"Adult, Alcohol Oxidoreductases, Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Carrier Proteins, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Healthy Volunteers, Humans, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Male, Middle Aged, Nuclear Proteins, Osteoarthritis, Protein Interaction Maps, Signal Transduction, Spondylitis, Ankylosing, Transcription Factors",Int J Immunogenet,10.1111/iji.12313,Wang
26110539,Evaluation of Appropriate Reference Genes for Gene Expression Normalization during Watermelon Fruit Development.,"Gene expression analysis in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) fruit has drawn considerable attention with the availability of genome sequences to understand the regulatory mechanism of fruit development and to improve its quality. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a routine technique for gene expression analysis. However, appropriate reference genes for transcript normalization in watermelon fruits have not been well characterized. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of 12 genes for their potential use as reference genes in watermelon fruits. Expression variations of these genes were measured in 48 samples obtained from 12 successive developmental stages of parthenocarpic and fertilized fruits of two watermelon genotypes by using qRT-PCR analysis. Considering the effects of genotype, fruit setting method, and developmental stage, geNorm determined clathrin adaptor complex subunit (ClCAC), β-actin (ClACT), and alpha tubulin 5 (ClTUA5) as the multiple reference genes in watermelon fruit. Furthermore, ClCAC alone or together with SAND family protein (ClSAND) was ranked as the single or two best reference genes by NormFinder. By using the top-ranked reference genes to normalize the transcript abundance of phytoene synthase (ClPSY1), a good correlation between lycopene accumulation and ClPSY1 expression pattern was observed in ripening watermelon fruit. These validated reference genes will facilitate the accurate measurement of gene expression in the studies on watermelon fruit biology.

24466117,Evaluation of reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression for real time-quantitative PCR in Pyrus pyrifolia using different tissue samples and seasonal conditions.,"We have evaluated suitable reference genes for real time (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis in Japanese pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). We tested most frequently used genes in the literature such as β-Tubulin, Histone H3, Actin, Elongation factor-1α, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, together with newly added genes Annexin, SAND and TIP41. A total of 17 primer combinations for these eight genes were evaluated using cDNAs synthesized from 16 tissue samples from four groups, namely: flower bud, flower organ, fruit flesh and fruit skin. Gene expression stabilities were analyzed using geNorm and NormFinder software packages or by ΔCt method. geNorm analysis indicated three best performing genes as being sufficient for reliable normalization of RT-qPCR data. Suitable reference genes were different among sample groups, suggesting the importance of validation of gene expression stability of reference genes in the samples of interest. Ranking of stability was basically similar between geNorm and NormFinder, suggesting usefulness of these programs based on different algorithms. ΔCt method suggested somewhat different results in some groups such as flower organ or fruit skin; though the overall results were in good correlation with geNorm or NormFinder. Gene expression of two cold-inducible genes PpCBF2 and PpCBF4 were quantified using the three most and the three least stable reference genes suggested by geNorm. Although normalized quantities were different between them, the relative quantities within a group of samples were similar even when the least stable reference genes were used. Our data suggested that using the geometric mean value of three reference genes for normalization is quite a reliable approach to evaluating gene expression by RT-qPCR. We propose that the initial evaluation of gene expression stability by ΔCt method, and subsequent evaluation by geNorm or NormFinder for limited number of superior gene candidates will be a practical way of finding out reliable reference genes.

31731552,Transcriptional Regulation of Autophagy Genes via Stage-Specific Activation of CEBPB and PPARG during Adipogenesis: A Systematic Study Using Public Gene Expression and Transcription Factor Binding Datasets.,"Autophagy is the cell self-eating mechanism to maintain cell homeostasis by removing damaged intracellular proteins or organelles. It has also been implicated in the development and differentiation of various cell types including the adipocyte. Several links between adipogenic transcription factors and key autophagy genes has been suggested. In this study, we tried to model the gene expression and their transcriptional regulation during the adipocyte differentiation using high-throughput sequencing datasets of the 3T3-L1 cell model. We applied the gene expression and co-expression analysis to all and the subset of autophagy genes to study the binding, and occupancy patterns of adipogenic factors, co-factors and histone modifications on key autophagy genes. We also analyzed the gene expression of key autophagy genes under different transcription factor knockdown adipocyte cells. We found that a significant percent of the variance in the autophagy gene expression is explained by the differentiation stage of the cell. Adipogenic master regulators, such as CEBPB and PPARG target key autophagy genes directly. In addition, the same factor may also control autophagy gene expression indirectly through autophagy transcription factors such as FOXO1, TFEB or XBP1. Finally, the binding of adipogenic factors is associated with certain patterns of co-factors binding that might modulate the functions. Some of the findings were further confirmed under the knockdown of the adipogenic factors in the differentiating adipocytes. In conclusion, autophagy genes are regulated as part of the transcriptional programs through adipogenic factors either directly or indirectly through autophagy transcription factors during adipogenesis.",,,Cells,,Ahmed

Fourteen pregnant female rats were equally divided into two groups: a control group and a DBP-treated group. During gestation day (GD) 12 to postnatal day (PND) 14, the control group was administered 1 ml/day corn oil, and the DBP-treated group was administered DBP 500 mg/kg/day by oral gavage. On PND 25 (pre-puberty) and PND 60 (post-puberty), blood for serum and the testes were collected from five male offspring of each group. To determine the relationship between the methylation state of the c-Myc promoter and the expression of the c-Myc gene, some apoptotic-related genes, such as p53 and Bax, the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene, and some growth arrest-related genes, such as BRD7 and GAS1, were examined. Compared with the control ( p < 0.05), at pre-puberty, DBP induces c-Myc hyper-methylation with significant downregulation for c-Myc, p53, Bax genes, and significant upregulation for Bcl-2, BRD7, and GAS1, while at post puberty, the methylation state and expression of c-Myc and apoptosis-related genes returned to control levels in the same sequence with the fold change in the expression of BRD7 and GAS1 genes. These findings suggest that DBP induced a transient pre-pubertal increase in c-Myc promoter methylation that may be associated with disruption of both apoptotic and growth mechanisms in the testes.",2019-01-29,"Animals, Apoptosis, Dibutyl Phthalate, Female, Genes, myc, Male, Maternal Exposure, Pregnancy, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Testis",Toxicol Ind Health,10.1177/0748233718791623,Rashad
29806629,Construction of a β-galactosidase-gene-based fusion is convenient for screening candidate genes involved in regulation of pyrrolnitrin biosynthesis in Pseudomonas chlororaphis G05.,"In our recent work, we found that pyrrolnitrin, and not phenazines, contributed to the suppression of the mycelia growth of Fusarium graminearum that causes heavy Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease in cereal crops. However, pyrrolnitrin production of Pseudomonas chlororaphis G05 in King's B medium was very low. Although a few regulatory genes mediating the prnABCD (the prn operon, pyrrolnitrin biosynthetic locus) expression have been identified, it is not enough for us to enhance pyrrolnitrin production by systematically constructing a genetically-engineered strain. To obtain new candidate genes involved in the regulation of the prn operon expression, we successfully constructed a fusion mutant G05ΔphzΔprn::lacZ, in which most of the coding regions of the prn operon and the phzABCDEFG (the phz operon, phenazine biosynthetic locus) were deleted, and the promoter region plus the first thirty condons of the prnA was in-frame fused with the truncated lacZ gene on its chromosome. The expression of the fused lacZ reporter gene driven by the promoter of the prn operon made it easy for us to detect the level of the prn expression in terms of the color variation of colonies on LB agar plates supplemented with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal). With this fusion mutant as a recipient strain, mini-Tn5-based random insertional mutagenesis was then conducted. By picking up colonies with color change, it is possible for us to screen and identify new candidate genes involved in the regulation of the prn expression. Identification of additional regulatory genes in further work could reasonably be expected to increase pyrrolnitrin production in G05 and to improve its biological control function.",2019-02-26,"Antifungal Agents, Bacterial Proteins, DNA Transposable Elements, Fusarium, Gene Deletion, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Mutagenesis, Insertional, Operon, Pest Control, Biological, Phenazines, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, Pyrrolnitrin, beta-Galactosidase",J Gen Appl Microbiol,10.2323/jgam.2018.01.003,Luo

28573671,Validation of reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis in experimental epilepsy.,"To grasp the molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying epilepsy development (epileptogenesis) and epilepsy itself, it is important to understand the gene expression changes that occur during these phases. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a technique that rapidly and accurately determines gene expression changes. It is crucial, however, that stable reference genes are selected for each experimental condition to ensure that accurate values are obtained for genes of interest. If reference genes are unstably expressed, this can lead to inaccurate data and erroneous conclusions. To date, epilepsy studies have used mostly single, nonvalidated reference genes. This is the first study to systematically evaluate reference genes in male Sprague-Dawley rat models of epilepsy. We assessed 15 potential reference genes in hippocampal tissue obtained from 2 different models during epileptogenesis, 1 model during chronic epilepsy, and a model of noninjurious seizures. Reference gene ranking varied between models and also differed between epileptogenesis and chronic epilepsy time points. There was also some variance between the four mathematical models used to rank reference genes. Notably, we found novel reference genes to be more stably expressed than those most often used in experimental epilepsy studies. The consequence of these findings is that reference genes suitable for one epilepsy model may not be appropriate for others and that reference genes can change over time. It is, therefore, critically important to validate potential reference genes before using them as normalizing factors in expression analysis in order to ensure accurate, valid results.",2018-06-08,"Animals, Epilepsy, Gene Expression Profiling, Male, Rats, Rats, Sprague-Dawley",J Neurosci Res,10.1002/jnr.24089,Sadangi

The Hevea bark is commercially exploited to obtain latex, which is produced from the articulated secondary laticifer. The laticifer is well defined in the aspect of morphology; however, only some genes associated with its development have been reported. We successfully induced secondary laticifer in the jasmonic acid (JA)-treated and linolenic acid (LA)-treated Hevea bark but secondary laticifer is not observed in the ethephon (ET)-treated and untreated Hevea bark. In this study, we analysed 27,195 gene models using NimbleGen microarrays based on the Hevea draft genome. 491 filtered differentially expressed (FDE) transcripts that are common to both JA- and LA-treated bark samples but not ET-treated bark samples were identified. In the Eukaryotic Orthologous Group (KOG) analysis, 491 FDE transcripts belong to different functional categories that reflect the diverse processes and pathways involved in laticifer differentiation. In the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and KOG analysis, the profile of the FDE transcripts suggest that JA- and LA-treated bark samples have a sufficient molecular basis for secondary laticifer differentiation, especially regarding secondary metabolites metabolism. FDE genes in this category are from the cytochrome (CYP) P450 family, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family, short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) family, or cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) family. The data includes many genes involved in cell division, cell wall synthesis, and cell differentiation. The most abundant transcript in FDE list was SDR65C, reflecting its importance in laticifer differentiation. Using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) as part of annotation and functional prediction, several characterised as well as uncharacterized transcription factors and genes were found in the dataset. Hence, the further characterization of these genes is necessary to unveil their role in laticifer differentiation.

To date, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of drought resistance in C. thesioides. To better understand drought resistance, we used transcriptome analysis and Illumina sequencing technology on C. thesioides, to identify drought-responsive genes. Using de novo assembly 55,268 unigenes were identified from 207.58 Gb of clean data. Amongst these, 36,265 were annotated with gene descriptions, conserved domains, gene ontology terms and metabolic pathways. The sequencing results showed that genes that were differentially expressed (DEGs) under drought stress were enriched in pathways such as carbon metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and plant hormone signal transduction. Moreover, many functional genes were up-regulated under severe drought stress to enhance tolerance. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis showed that there were key hub genes related to drought stress. Hundreds of candidate genes were identified under severe drought stress, including transcriptional factors such as MYB, G2-like, ERF, C2H2, NAC, NF-X1, GRF, HD-ZIP, HB-other, HSF, C3H, GRAS, WRKY, bHLH and Trihelix.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened for in the blood samples from patients with ruptured IAs and controls, followed by functional and pathway enrichment analyses. In addition, gene co-expression network was constructed and significant modules were extracted from the network by WGCNA R package. Screening for miRNAs that could regulate DEGs in the modules was performed and an analysis of regulatory relationships was conducted. RESULTS A total of 304 DEGs (167 up-regulated and 137 down-regulated genes) were screened for in blood samples from patients with ruptured IAs compared with those from controls. Functional enrichment analysis showed that the up-regulated genes were mainly associated with immune response and the down-regulated DEGs were mainly concerned with the structure of ribosome and translation. Besides, six functional modules were significantly identified, including four modules enriched by up-regulated genes and two modules enriched by down-regulated genes. Thereinto, the blue, yellow, and turquoise modules of up-regulated genes were all linked with immune response. Additionally, 16 miRNAs were predicted to regulate DEGs in the three modules associated with immune response, such as hsa-miR-1304, hsa-miR-33b, hsa-miR-125b, and hsa-miR-125a-5p. CONCLUSIONS Several genes and miRNAs (such as miR-1304, miR-33b, IRS2 and KCNJ2) may take part in the pathogenesis of IAs.",2018-05-23,"Aneurysm, Ruptured, Case-Control Studies, Computational Biology, Databases, Nucleic Acid, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Insulin Receptor Substrate Proteins, Intracranial Aneurysm, MicroRNAs, Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying, Transcriptional Activation, Up-Regulation",Med Sci Monit,10.12659/msm.902953,Bo

25370817,A combination of gene expression ranking and co-expression network analysis increases discovery rate in large-scale mutant screens for novel Arabidopsis thaliana abiotic stress genes.,"As challenges to food security increase, the demand for lead genes for improving crop production is growing. However, genetic screens of plant mutants typically yield very low frequencies of desired phenotypes. Here, we present a powerful computational approach for selecting candidate genes for screening insertion mutants. We combined ranking of Arabidopsis thaliana regulatory genes according to their expression in response to multiple abiotic stresses (Multiple Stress [MST] score), with stress-responsive RNA co-expression network analysis to select candidate multiple stress regulatory (MSTR) genes. Screening of 62 T-DNA insertion mutants defective in candidate MSTR genes, for abiotic stress germination phenotypes yielded a remarkable hit rate of up to 62%; this gene discovery rate is 48-fold greater than that of other large-scale insertional mutant screens. Moreover, the MST score of these genes could be used to prioritize them for screening. To evaluate the contribution of the co-expression analysis, we screened 64 additional mutant lines of MST-scored genes that did not appear in the RNA co-expression network. The screening of these MST-scored genes yielded a gene discovery rate of 36%, which is much higher than that of classic mutant screens but not as high as when picking candidate genes from the co-expression network. The MSTR co-expression network that we created, AraSTressRegNet is publicly available at http://netbio.bgu.ac.il/arnet. This systems biology-based screening approach combining gene ranking and network analysis could be generally applicable to enhancing identification of genes regulating additional processes in plants and other organisms provided that suitable transcriptome data are available.

22561114,"Identification and characterization of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase genes in Arabidopsis reveal a gene family with diverse responses to abiotic stresses.","Fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key enzyme in plants, which is involved not only in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis in the cytoplasm, but also in the Calvin cycle in plastids. Research on FBAs in various organisms has been reported, but there is none on FBAs in Arabidopsis at the molecular level. In the current study, eight FBA family genes (AtFBA1-8) were identified and analyzed in Arabidopsis thaliana. These genes have a highly conserved aldolase-type TIM barrel domain and a C-terminal peptide, but variable N-terminal peptides. Based on the phylogenetic analysis of FBA protein sequences from Arabidopsis and other plant species, AtFBA family was classified into two subfamilies, including three members (AtFBA1-3) with high similarities to FBAs occurring at plastid, and five (AtFBA4-8) with high similarities to FBAs localized in the cytoplasm. By confocal microscopy analysis with GFP fusion protein, AtFBA3 and AtFBA4 as well as AtFBA6 were observed to be localized in the plastid and cytoplasm, respectively. At least two duplicated gene pairs of AtFBA1 and AtFBA2, as well as AtFBA4 and AtFBA8 were found. Transcript level analysis of AtFBA genes in various tissues revealed the unique and overlapping expression patterns of plastid and cytosol AtFBA genes, suggesting that these genes may function at different stages of plant growth and development. Interestingly, AtFBA1, AtFBA2, AtFBA5 and AtFBA7 showed undetectable expression in roots. The expression patterns of AtFBA genes under different stress conditions suggested that all the members showed different expression patterns in response to stresses, including ABA, NaCl, Cd, abnormal temperature and drought, and, except for AtFBA3, most of the AtFBA genes were significantly responsive to drought stress in roots. Moreover, AtFBA1, AtFBA2, AtFBA5, AtFBA7 and AtFBA8 were induced by at least one of three sugars (sucrose, glucose and fructose) after 24h of treatment. Further functional analyses indicated important clues of AtFBA2, AtFBA6 and AtFBA8 in plant growth, stress responses and development, respectively. Thus these results provide additional knowledge on AtFBA families and their roles.",2012-08-17,"Arabidopsis, Cytoplasm, Droughts, Fructose, Fructose-Bisphosphate Aldolase, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Glucose, Multigene Family, Phylogeny, Plant Roots, Plastids, Sodium Chloride, Stress, Physiological, Sucrose",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.042,Lu
31025715,Identification of Suitable Reference Genes for Quantitative Gene Expression Analysis in Innervated and Denervated Adipose Tissue from Cafeteria Diet-Fed Rats.,"Our previous studies show that cafeteria diet increases body adiposity, plasma insulin levels, and sympathetic activity to brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) of Wistar rats, leading to rapid and progressive changes in the metabolic profile. The identification of suitable reference genes that are not affected by the experimental conditions is a critical step in accurate normalization of the reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), a commonly used assay to elucidate changes in the gene expression profile. In the present study, the effects of the cafeteria diet and sympathetic innervation on the gene expression of adrenoceptor beta 3 (Adrb3) from BAT and WAT were assessed using one of the most stable and one of the least stable genes as normalizers. Rats were fed the cafeteria diet and on the 17th day, interscapular BAT or retroperitoneal WAT was denervated and, 7 days after surgery, the contralateral innervated tissue was used as control. Ten reference genes were evaluated (18S, B2m, Actb, CypA, Gapdh, Hprt1, Rpl32, Tbp, Ubc, and Ywhaz) and ranked according to their stability using the following algorithms: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and comparative delta threshold cycle (ΔC ",2019-09-02,"Adipose Tissue, Brown, Adipose Tissue, White, Animals, Diet, Gene Expression Profiling, Male, Rats, Rats, Wistar, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3",Lipids,10.1002/lipd.12144,Marques-Oliveira

29378241,A small set of differentially expressed genes was associated with two color morphs in natural populations of the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum.,"Color polymorphism is an ecologically important trait, which is related to local adaptation and ecological speciation. The pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum shows color polymorphism: the red and green color morphs where differences in ecological adaptation have been observed. Here, we measured genome-wide gene expression profiles of two color morphs in natural populations of A. pisum to explore the genetic basis of differentiated ecological adaptation. The results showed that only 32 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two morphs, of which 18 had functional annotations. Among them, 13 genes were up-regulated [e.g. genes encoding protoheme IX farnesyltransferase (LOC100570971), carotene dehydrogenase (tor) and V-type proton ATPase subunit B (LOC100169462)] and 5 genes were down-regulated in the red morph (e.g. genes encoding transcription factors and heat shock proteins). To assess the functional importance of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we selected three highly expressed DEGs (LOC100169462, LOC100570971 and tor) with functional annotations and analyzed their expression levels in the red morph under three low temperatures (1 °C, 4 °C, and 8 °C) for 24 h. These three DEGs showed an interesting expression response to the cold acclimating conditions which resulted in an obvious phenotypic change of the red individuals to be greenish variants. This study suggests a link between gene expressions and body color polymorphisms in the pea aphid and provides important clues for further studying molecular mechanisms of ecological adaptation in aphids.",2018-03-09,"Animals, Aphids, Cold Temperature, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Ontology, Genes, Insect, Medicago sativa, Pigmentation, Polymorphism, Genetic, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Transcriptome, beta-Carotene 15,15'-Monooxygenase",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.01.079,Zhang
27125224,Gene expression profiles of autophagy-related genes in multiple sclerosis.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an imflammatory disease of central nervous system caused by genetic and environmental factors that remain largely unknown. Autophagy is the process of degradation and recycling of damaged cytoplasmic organelles, macromolecular aggregates, and long-lived proteins. Malfunction of autophagy contributes to the pathogenesis of neurological diseases, and autophagy genes may modulate the T cell survival. We aimed to examine the expression levels of autophagy-related genes. The blood samples of 95 unrelated patients (aged 17-65years, 37 male, 58 female) diagnosed as MS and 95 healthy controls were used to extract the RNA samples. After conversion to single stranded cDNA using polyT priming: the targeted genes were pre-amplified, and 96×78 (samples×primers) qRT-PCR reactions were performed for each primer pair on each sample on a 96.96 array of Fluidigm BioMark™. Compared to age- and sex-matched controls, gene expression levels of ATG16L2, ATG9A, BCL2, FAS, GAA, HGS, PIK3R1, RAB24, RGS19, ULK1, FOXO1, HTT were significantly altered (false discovery rate<0.05). Thus, altered expression levels of several autophagy related genes may affect protein levels, which in turn would influence the activity of autophagy, or most probably, those genes might be acting independent of autophagy and contributing to MS pathogenesis as risk factors. The indeterminate genetic causes leading to alterations in gene expressions require further analysis.

26102481,Analyses of interactions among pair-rule genes and the gap gene Krüppel in Bombyx segmentation.,"In the short-germ insect Tribolium, a pair-rule gene circuit consisting of the Tribolium homologs of even-skipped, runt, and odd-skipped (Tc-eve, Tc-run and Tc-odd, respectively) has been implicated in segment formation. To examine the application of the model to other taxa, I studied the expression and function of pair-rule genes in Bombyx mori, together with a Bombyx homolog of Krüppel (Bm-Kr), a known gap gene. Knockdown embryos of Bombyx homologs of eve, run and odd (Bm-eve, Bm-run and Bm-odd) exhibited asegmental phenotypes similar to those of Tribolium knockdowns. However, pair-rule gene interactions were similar to those of both Tribolium and Drosophila, which, different from Tribolium, shows a hierarchical segmentation mode. Additionally, the Bm-odd expression pattern shares characteristics with those of Drosophila pair-rule genes that receive upstream regulatory input. On the other hand, Bm-Kr knockdowns exhibited a large posterior segment deletion as observed in short-germ insects. However, a detailed analysis of these embryos indicated that Bm-Kr modulates expression of pair-rule genes like in Drosophila, although the mechanisms appear to be different. This suggested hierarchical interactions between Bm-Kr and pair-rule genes. Based on these results, I concluded that the pair-rule gene circuit model that describes Tribolium development is not applicable to Bombyx.

However, the pullulan biosynthesis mechanism remains unclear. This work proposed a pathway suggesting that heavy oil and melanin may correlate with pullulan production. The effects of overexpression or deletion of genes encoding apolipoprotein, UDPG-pyrophosphorylase, glucosyltransferase, and α-phosphoglucose mutase on the production of pullulan, heavy oil, and melanin were examined. Pullulan production increased by 16.93 and 8.52% with the overexpression of UDPG-pyrophosphorylase and apolipoprotein genes, respectively. Nevertheless, the overexpression or deletion of other genes exerted little effect on pullulan biosynthesis. Heavy oil production increased by 146.30, 64.81, and 33.33% with the overexpression of UDPG-pyrophosphorylase, α-phosphoglucose mutase, and apolipoprotein genes, respectively.

However, traditional DGE analysis (e.g., the t test or the rank sum test) tests each gene independently without considering interactions between them. Top-ranked differentially regulated genes prioritized by the analysis may not directly relate to the coherent molecular changes underlying complex diseases. Joint analyses of co-expression and DGE have been applied to reveal the deregulated molecular modules underlying complex diseases. Most of these methods consist of separate steps: first to identify gene-gene relationships under the studied phenotype then to integrate them with gene expression changes for prioritizing signature genes, or vice versa.

We hypothesized that Arachis species evolved genes specifically involved in the control of aerial flowers and the formation of underground fruits. Arachis duranensis is more resistant to biotic and abiotic stressors. Here, we compared different legume species and identified Arachis duranensis-specific genes. We analyzed gene expression patterns, base substitution patterns and sequence features between genes that are conserved across legume plants and A. duranensis-specific genes. Furthermore, we tested the role of A. duranensis-specific genes during seed development, response to nematode Meloidogyne arenaria infection and drought stress. We found that A. duranensis-specific genes had characteristics of young genes. The gene expression level and breadth were lower in the A. duranensis-specific genes compared to conserved genes. The A. duranensis-specific genes had higher codon usage bias than conserved genes, and the polypeptide length and GC content at the three codon sites were lower compared to conserved genes. Of the A. duranensis-specific genes, single-copy and duplicated genes had different features.

In this study, we found an expansion of SLC6 family gene in the genome of chordate invertebrate Ciona savignyi. A total of 40 candidate genes including 29 complete and 11 putative genes were identified as SLC6 family gene homologs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of these Ciona SLC6 genes were highly conserved with the vertebrate ones, although gene duplication and gene losses did exist. Four genes were selected from SLC6 subfamilies to be further investigated for their functional characteristics on cell growth and migration through overexpression approach in cultured cell lines. The results showed both SLC6A7 and SLC6A17 from amino acid transporters AA1 and AA2 sub-families, respectively, significantly suppressed the cell proliferation and migration. While SLC6A1 and SLC6A4, which were classified into GABA and monoamine transporters, respectively, did not affect the cell proliferation and migration in HEK293T, HeLa, and MCF7 cells.

Due to its unique composition, in recent years an increasing interest in mare's milk consumption has been observed. Thus, investigating the genetic background of horse's milk variability presents and interesting study model. Relying on 39 milk samples collected from mares representing three breeds (Polish Primitive Horse, Polish Cold-blooded Horse, Polish Warmblood Horse) we aimed to investigate the utility of equine milk somatic cells as a source of mRNA and to screen the best reference genes for RT-qPCR using geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The results showed that despite relatively low somatic cell counts in mare's milk, the amount and the quality of the extracted RNA are sufficient for gene expression studies. The analysis of the utility of 7 potential reference genes for RT-qPCR experiments for the normalization of equine milk somatic cells revealed some differences between the outcomes of the applied algorithms, although in both cases the KRT8 and TOP2B genes were pointed as the most stable. Analysis by geNorm showed that the combination of 4 reference genes (ACTB, GAPDH, TOP2B and KRT8) is required for apropriate RT-qPCR experiments normalization, whereas NormFinder algorithm pointed the combination of KRT8 and RPS9 genes as the most suitable.

The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used to perform Gene Ontology analysis. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed to obtain the up- and downregulated pathways in ASPS. The Distant Regulatory Elements of co-regulated genes database was used to identify the transcription factors (TFs) that were enriched in the signaling pathways. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database and was visualized using Cytoscape software. A total of 71 DEGs, including 59 upregulated genes and 12 downregulated genes, were identified. Gene sets associated with ASPS were enriched primarily in four signaling pathways: The phenylalanine metabolism pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, the taste transduction pathway and the intestinal immune network for the production of immunoglobulin A. Furthermore, 107 TFs were identified to be enriched in the MAPK signaling pathway. Certain genes, including those coding for Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1, kinase insert domain receptor, E-selectin and platelet-derived growth factor receptor D, that were associated with other genes in the PPI network, were identified.

24055488,Polymorphic core promoter GA-repeats alter gene expression of the early embryonic developmental genes.,"Protein complexes that bind to 'GAGA' DNA elements are necessary to replace nucleosomes to create a local chromatin environment that facilitates a variety of site-specific regulatory responses. Three to four elements are required for the disruption of a preassembled nucleosome. We have previously identified human protein-coding gene core promoters that are composed of exceptionally long GA-repeats. The functional implication of those GA-repeats is beginning to emerge in the core promoter of the human SOX5 gene, which is involved in multiple developmental processes. In the current study, we analyze the functional implication of GA-repeats in the core promoter of two additional genes, MECOM and GABRA3, whose expression is largely limited to embryogenesis. We report a significant difference in gene expression as a result of different alleles across those core promoters in the HEK-293 cell line. Across-species homology check for the GABRA3 GA-repeats revealed that those repeats are evolutionary conserved in mouse and primates (p<1 × 10(-8)).

31882847,Selection of Reference Genes for qPCR Analyses of Gene Expression in Ramie Leaves and Roots across Eleven Abiotic/Biotic Treatments.,"Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is commonly used for deciphering gene functions. For effective qPCR analyses, suitable reference genes are needed for normalization. The objective of this study is to identify the appropriate reference gene(s) for qPCR analyses of the leaves and roots of ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.), an important natural fiber crop. To accomplish this goal, we investigated the expression patterns of eight common plant qPCR reference genes in ramie leaves and roots under five abiotic stresses, five hormonal treatments, and one biotic stress. The relative expression stabilities of the eight genes were evaluated using four common but different approaches: geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. Across the 11 tested conditions, ACT1 was the most stably expressed among the eight genes while GAPDH displayed the biggest variation. Overall, while variations in the suggested reference genes were found for different tissue x treatment combinations, our analyses revealed that together, genes ACT1, CYP2, and UBQ can provide robust references for gene expression studies of ramie leaves under most conditions, while genes EF-1α, TUB, and ACT1 can be used for similar studies of ramie roots. Our results should help future functional studies of the genes in ramie genome across tissues and environmental conditions.",,,Sci Rep,,Yu

30371900,Ancestral Genomes: a resource for reconstructed ancestral genes and genomes across the tree of life.,"A growing number of whole genome sequencing projects, in combination with development of phylogenetic methods for reconstructing gene evolution, have provided us with a window into genomes that existed millions, and even billions, of years ago. Ancestral Genomes (http://ancestralgenomes.org) is a resource for comprehensive reconstructions of these 'fossil genomes'. Comprehensive sets of protein-coding genes have been reconstructed for 78 genomes of now-extinct species that were the common ancestors of extant species from across the tree of life. The reconstructed genes are based on the extensive library of over 15 000 gene family trees from the PANTHER database, and are updated on a yearly basis. For each ancestral gene, we assign a stable identifier, and provide additional information designed to facilitate analysis: an inferred name, a reconstructed protein sequence, a set of inferred Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, and a 'proxy gene' for each ancestral gene, defined as the least-diverged descendant of the ancestral gene in a given extant genome. On the Ancestral Genomes website, users can browse the Ancestral Genomes by selecting nodes in a species tree, and can compare an extant genome with any of its reconstructed ancestors to understand how the genome evolved.",2020-05-13,"Animals, Databases, Genetic, Eukaryota, Evolution, Molecular, Extinction, Biological, Genes, Genes, Archaeal, Genes, Bacterial, Genes, Protozoan, Genome, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Phylogeny, Software",Nucleic Acids Res,,Huang

MiR-339 and miR-766 have been predicted to target 3'UTR of DNMT3B gene. Luciferase reporter assay validated that individual and co-transfection of miR-766 and miR-339 into the HEK293T cell reduced luciferase activity to 26% ± 0.41%, 43% ± 0.42 and 64% ± 0.52%, respectively, compared to the control (P < 0.05). Furthermore, transduction of miR-339 and miR-766 expressing viruses into colon cancer cell lines (SW480 and HCT116) decreased DNMT3B expression (1.5, 3-fold) and (3, 4-fold), respectively. In addition, DNA methylation of some tumor suppressor genes decreased. Expression of these genes such as SFRP1 (2 and 1.6-fold), SFRP2 (0.07 and 4-fold), WIF1 (0.05 and 4-fold), and DKK2 (2 and 4-fold) increased in SW-339 and SW-766 cell lines; besides, expression increments for these genes in HCT-339 and HCT-766 cell lines were (2.8, 4-fold), (0.005, 1.5-fold), (1.7 and 3-fold) and (0.04, 1.7-fold), respectively. Also, while in SW-766, cell proliferation reduced to 2.8% and 21.7% after 24 and 48 hours, respectively, SW-339 showed no reduced proliferation. Meanwhile, HCT-766 and HCT-339 showed (3.5%, 12.8%) and (18.8%, 33.9%) reduced proliferation after 24 and 48 hours, respectively.

Two gene expression datasets of breast cancer were downloaded from ArrayExpress and genes from these datasets with a coefficient of variation >0.5 were selected and underwent functional enrichment analysis with the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. Gene co-expression networks were constructed with the WGCNA package in R. Modules were identified from the network via cluster analysis. Cox regression was conducted to analyze survival rates. A total of 2,669 genes were selected, and functional enrichment analysis of them revealed that they were mainly associated with the immune response, cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell adhesion. Seven modules were identified from the gene co-expression network, one of which was found to be significantly associated with patient survival time. Expression status of 144 genes from this module was used to cluster patient samples into two groups, with a significant difference in survival time revealed between these groups.

The development of salt-tolerant rice through molecular breeding methods is important to meet the needs of rice breeding. We used 295 accessions to perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of salt tolerance-related phenotypes in rice at the seedling stage and obtained 93 candidate genes with high association peaks across six phenotypes. We constructed a protein interaction network using the candidate genes identified here, and 33 genes were associated. Based on the expression patterns, we found that most of these genes showed a different expression level under control and salt stress conditions. In addition, haplotype network and sequence analysis of one 'key' gene, a transcription factor (Os12g0176700) encoding a SWIRM domain-containing protein, in the interaction network was investigated to explore its possible role in the network. Our study revealed candidate salt tolerance-related genes in rice at the seedling stage, and demonstrated the feasibility of using GWAS to identify genetic architecture underlying salt tolerance.

25391499,The choice of reference genes for assessing gene expression in sugarcane under salinity and drought stresses.,"Sugarcane (Saccharum spp. hybrids) is a world-wide cash crop for sugar and biofuel in tropical and subtropical regions and suffers serious losses in cane yield and sugar content under salinity and drought stresses. Although real-time quantitative PCR has a numerous advantage in the expression quantification of stress-related genes for the elaboration of the corresponding molecular mechanism in sugarcane, the variation happened across the process of gene expression quantification should be normalized and monitored by introducing one or several reference genes. To validate suitable reference genes or gene sets for sugarcane gene expression normalization, 13 candidate reference genes have been tested across 12 NaCl- and PEG-treated sugarcane samples for four sugarcane genotypes using four commonly used systematic statistical algorithms termed geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and the deltaCt method. The results demonstrated that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and eukaryotic elongation factor 1-alpha (eEF-1a) were identified as suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization under salinity/drought-treatment in sugarcane. Moreover, the expression analyses of SuSK and 6PGDH further validated that a combination of clathrin adaptor complex (CAC) and cullin (CUL) as reference should be better for gene expression normalization.

31257478,Significantly dysregulated genes in osteoarthritic labrum cells identified through gene expression profiling.,"The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular basis and identify significant genetic alterations in acetabular labrum cells associated with osteoarthritis (OA). Gene expression data of osteoarthritic and normal human labrum cells were downloaded from a public database and reanalyzed. Significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were acquired by performing a thorough analysis of microarray data between the OA acetabular labrum cells and control cells. Key genes in OA labrum cells were revealed by a combination of weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) analysis. Literature mining and drug screening were further performed for these key genes. In total, 141 DEGs between OA and normal labrum cells were identified. In addition, WGCNA and PPI analysis identified 23 DEGs as key genes in the OA labrum. All the key genes were significantly downregulated in OA labrum cells and were grouped into two different WGCNA‑PPI common subnetworks. Kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), CD34, cadherin 5 (CDH5), Fms related tyrosine kinase 1 (FLT1) and asporin were hub nodes in the PPI network of DEGs. These key genes were significantly enriched in functional clusters of transforming growth factor, alkaline phosphatase, bone morphogenic protein and extracellular matrix. Drug screening analysis identified several drugs targeting the key genes, including arachidonic acid, yohimbic acid and mimosine. The results of the present study indicate that the changes of FLT1, KDR, CD34 and CDH5 in acetabular labrum cells may be involved in the pathogenesis of OA and could serve as biomarkers and therapeutic targets of OA. Additionally, arachidonic acid, yohimbic acid and mimosine may act as potential drugs for OA.",2019-12-30,"Cartilage, Articular, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Osteoarthritis, Protein Interaction Maps, Transcriptome",Mol Med Rep,,Wang

31759986,Analysis of the microarray gene expression for breast cancer progression after the application modified logistic regression.,"Methods based around statistics and linear algebra have been increasingly used in attempts to address emerging questions in microarray literature. Microarray technology is a long-used tool in the global analysis of gene expression, allowing for the simultaneous investigation of hundreds or thousands of genes in a sample. It is characterized by a low sample size and a large feature number created a non-square matrix, and by the incomplete rank, that can generate countless more solution in classifiers. To avoid the problem of the 'curse of dimensionality' many authors have performed feature selection or reduced the size of data matrix. In this work, we introduce a new logistic regression-based model to classify breast cancer tumor samples based on microarray expression data, including all features of gene expression and without reducing the microarray data matrix. If the user still deems it necessary to perform feature reduction, it can be done after the application of the methodology, still maintaining a good classification. This methodology allowed the correct classification of breast cancer sample data sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data series GSE65194, GSE20711, and GSE25055, which contain the microarray data of said breast cancer samples. Classification had a minimum performance of 80% (sensitivity and specificity), and explored all possible data combinations, including breast cancer subtypes. This methodology highlighted genes not yet studied in breast cancer, some of which have been observed in Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs). In this work we examine the patterns and features of a GRN composed of transcription factors (TFs) in MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, providing valuable information regarding breast cancer. In particular, some genes whose αi ∗ associated parameter values revealed extreme positive and negative values, and, as such, can be identified as breast cancer prediction genes. We indicate that the PKN2, MKL1, MED23, CUL5 and GLI genes demonstrate a tumor suppressor profile, and that the MTR, ITGA2B, TELO2, MRPL9, MTTL1, WIPI1, KLHL20, PI4KB, FOLR1 and SHC1 genes demonstrate an oncogenic profile. We propose that these may serve as potential breast cancer prediction genes, and should be prioritized for further clinical studies on breast cancer. This new model allows for the assignment of values to the αi ∗ parameters associated with gene expression. It was noted that some αi ∗ parameters are associated with genes previously described as breast cancer biomarkers, as well as other genes not yet studied in relation to this disease.",2020-01-06,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Breast Neoplasms, Cell Line, Tumor, Disease Progression, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Logistic Models, MCF-7 Cells, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Transcription Factors",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144168,Morais-Rodrigues
30648612,LoiA directly represses lon gene expression to activate the expression of Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 genes.,"Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium uses virulence factors encoded by Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) to invade the intestinal epithelium. The low oxygen-induced transcriptional regulator LoiA is established to be a positive regulator of SPI-1 genes and can also repress the expression of the ATP-dependent Lon protease, a negative regulator of SPI-1 genes. Whether the repression of lon by LoiA is associated with its regulation of SPI-1 genes, as well as the regulatory mechanism involved, is unknown. In this study, we showed that LoiA directly represses the expression of the lon gene during invasion by binding to the promoter region of lon. The activation of S. Typhimurium SPI-1 gene expression by LoiA is associated with its repression of lon. Moreover, through invasion and mouse infection assays, we found that the repression of lon by LoiA contributes to S. Typhimurium invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and virulence in mice. However, LoiA does not influence lon expression during S. Typhimurium growth in macrophages, which may be associated with the low expression level of loiA in macrophages. Collectively, these findings establish the direct regulation of lon by LoiA and describe a novel mechanism by which LoiA regulates SPI-1 gene expression.",2019-08-27,"Animals, Bacterial Proteins, Caco-2 Cells, Disease Models, Animal, Epithelial Cells, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genomic Islands, Humans, Macrophages, Mice, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Protease La, Protein Binding, RAW 264.7 Cells, Salmonella Infections, Salmonella typhimurium, Transcription Factors, Virulence, Virulence Factors",Res Microbiol,10.1016/j.resmic.2019.01.001,Jiang

Its genome harbors up to 5% of genes that were most likely acquired through horizontal gene transfer. These genes probably contributed to G.sulphuraria's adaptation to its extreme habitats, resulting in today's polyextremophilic traits. Here, we applied RNA-sequencing to obtain insights into the acclimation of a thermophilic organism towards temperatures below its growth optimum and to study how horizontally acquired genes contribute to cold acclimation. A decrease in growth temperature from 42ï¿½C/46ï¿½C to 28ï¿½C resulted in an upregulation of ribosome biosynthesis, while excreted proteins, probably components of the cell wall, were downregulated. Photosynthesis was suppressed at cold temperatures, and transcript abundances indicated that C-metabolism switched from gluconeogenesis to glycogen degradation. Folate cycle and S-adenosylmethionine cycle (one-carbon metabolism) were transcriptionally upregulated, probably to drive the biosynthesis of betaine. All these cold-induced changes in gene expression were reversible upon return to optimal growth temperature. Numerous genes acquired by horizontal gene transfer displayed temperature-dependent expression changes, indicating that these genes contributed to adaptive evolution in G.sulphuraria.",2019-06-21,"Adaptation, Physiological, Algal Proteins, Cold Temperature, Cold-Shock Response, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Phylogeny, Rhodophyta, Systems Biology",Plant Cell Physiol,10.1093/pcp/pcy240,Rossoni

Although the biosynthesis pathways of secondary metabolites have been extensively studied, the regulatory mechanism of gene expression involved in these pathways remains poorly understood. In this study, we develop a virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system that enables a rapid analysis of the regulatory mechanism of genes involved in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids, one of the largest groups in secondary metabolites, using hydroponically-grown Nicotiana benthamiana. Using VIGS, we successfully reduced the transcript levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase 1 (HMGR1), cycloartenol synthase 1 (CAS1), sterol side chain reductase 2 (SSR2) and S-adenosyl-L-Met-dependent C-24 sterol methyltransferase 1 (SMT1) in leaf, stem and root tissues in approximately 2 weeks. We identified novel feedback and feed-forward regulation of isoprenoid biosynthesis genes when CAS1, which encodes a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of sterols and steroidal glycoalkaloids, was down-regulated. Furthermore, the regulation of these genes differed among different tissues. These results demonstrate that our system can rapidly analyse the regulatory mechanisms involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites.",2019-11-25,"Biosynthetic Pathways, Feedback, Physiological, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Silencing, Genes, Plant, Hydroponics, Plant Viruses, Soil, Terpenes, Tobacco",Sci Rep,,Atsumi

However, novel genes are required for gene pyramiding to delay evolution of resistance to the currently deployed genes. Two PCR-based techniques were employed for screening of cry2-type genes in 129 Bt isolates from diverse habitats in India and 27 known Bt strains. cry2Ab-type genes were more prevalent than cry2Aa- and cry2Ac-type genes. Correlation between source of isolates and abundance of cry2-type genes was not observed. Full-length cry2A-type genes were amplified by PCR from 9 Bt isolates and 4 Bt strains. The genes from Bt isolates SK-758 from Sorghum grain dust and SK-793 from Chilli seeds warehouse, Andhra Pradesh, were cloned and sequenced. The gene from SK-758 (NCBI GenBank accession No. GQ866915) was novel, while that from SK-793 (NCBI GenBank accession No. GQ866914) was identical to the cry2Ab1 gene.

24167633,Evaluation and validation of reference genes for normalization of quantitative real-time PCR based gene expression studies in peanut.,"The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) based techniques have become essential for gene expression studies and high-throughput molecular characterization of transgenic events. Normalizing to reference gene in relative quantification make results from qPCR more reliable when compared to absolute quantification, but requires robust reference genes. Since, ideal reference gene should be species specific, no single internal control gene is universal for use as a reference gene across various plant developmental stages and diverse growth conditions. Here, we present validation studies of multiple stably expressed reference genes in cultivated peanut with minimal variations in temporal and spatial expression when subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses. Stability in the expression of eight candidate reference genes including ADH3, ACT11, ATPsyn, CYP2, ELF1B, G6PD, LEC and UBC1 was compared in diverse peanut plant samples. The samples were categorized into distinct experimental sets to check the suitability of candidate genes for accurate and reliable normalization of gene expression using qPCR. Stability in expression of the references genes in eight sets of samples was determined by geNorm and NormFinder methods. While three candidate reference genes including ADH3, G6PD and ELF1B were identified to be stably expressed across experiments, LEC was observed to be the least stable, and hence must be avoided for gene expression studies in peanut. Inclusion of the former two genes gave sufficiently reliable results; nonetheless, the addition of the third reference gene ELF1B may be potentially better in a diverse set of tissue samples of peanut.

However, PHB production is costly due to expensive carbon sources for culturing PHB-accumulating microorganisms under sterile conditions. We discovered a hyper PHB-accumulating denitrifying bacterium, Zobellella denitrificans ZD1 (referred as strain ZD1 hereafter) capable of using non-sterile crude glycerol (a waste from biodiesel production) and nitrate to produce high PHB yield under saline conditions. Nevertheless, the underlying genetic mechanisms of PHB production in strain ZD1 have not been elucidated. In this study, we discovered a complete pathway of glycerol conversion to PHB, a novel PHB synthesis gene cluster, a salt-tolerant gene cluster, denitrifying genes, and an assimilatory nitrate reduction gene cluster in the ZD1 genome. Interestingly, the novel PHB synthesis gene cluster was found to be conserved among marine Gammaproteobacteria. Higher levels of PHB accumulation were linked to higher expression levels of the PHB synthesis gene cluster in ZD1 grown with glycerol and nitrate under saline conditions. Additionally, a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-Cas type-I-E antiviral system was found in the ZD1 genome along with a long spacer list, in which most of the spacers belong to either double-stranded DNA viruses or unknown phages.

Based on this, eight candidate C. roseus reference genes were identified and, together with RPS9, evaluated by performing qPCR on a series of different C. roseus explants and tissue cultures. NormFinder, geNorm and BestKeeper analyses of the resulting qPCR data revealed that the orthologs of At2g28390 (SAND family protein, SAND), At2g32170 (N2227-like family protein, N2227) and At4g26410 (Expressed protein, EXP) had the highest expression stability across the different C. roseus samples and are superior as reference genes as compared to the traditionally used RPS9. Analysis of publicly available C. roseus RNA-Seq data confirmed the expression stability of SAND and N2227, underscoring their value as reference genes for C. roseus qPCR analysis.

32183501,Gene Expression Profiling Indicated Diverse Functions and Characteristics of Core Genes in Pea Aphid.,"The pea aphid is a global insect pest, and variable phenotypes can be produced by pea aphids in the same genotype in response to changes in external environmental factors. However, detailed dynamic gene regulation networks and the core markers involved in different biological processes of pea aphids have not yet been reported. In this study, we obtained the published genomic and transcriptomic data, and performed transcriptome profiling of five pea aphid morphs (winged asexual female, wingless asexual female, wingless sexual female, winged male and wingless male) from each of three pea aphid genotypes, i.e., the transcriptomes from a total of 15 types of pea aphids were analyzed and the type-specific expression of genes in five different morphs was identified. The expression profiling was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis. Moreover, we determined the expression features and co-expression networks of highly variable genes. We also used the ARACNe method to obtain 263 core genes related to different biological pathways. Additionally, eight of the identified genes were aligned with transcription factor families, indicating that they act as transcription factors and regulate downstream genes. Furthermore, we found reliable markers using random forest methodology to distinguish different morphs of pea aphids. Our study provides a systematic and comprehensive approach for analyzing the core genes that may play important roles in a multitude of biological processes from the insect transcriptomes.",,,Insects,,Tian
28232943,Gastric Cancer Associated Genes Identified by an Integrative Analysis of Gene Expression Data.,"Gastric cancer is one of the most severe complex diseases with high morbidity and mortality in the world. The molecular mechanisms and risk factors for this disease are still not clear since the cancer heterogeneity caused by different genetic and environmental factors. With more and more expression data accumulated nowadays, we can perform integrative analysis for these data to understand the complexity of gastric cancer and to identify consensus players for the heterogeneous cancer. In the present work, we screened the published gene expression data and analyzed them with integrative tool, combined with pathway and gene ontology enrichment investigation. We identified several consensus differentially expressed genes and these genes were further confirmed with literature mining; at last, two genes, that is, immunoglobulin J chain and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 17, were screened as novel gastric cancer associated genes.

21269461,Identification of disease-causing genes using microarray data mining and Gene Ontology.,"One of the best and most accurate methods for identifying disease-causing genes is monitoring gene expression values in different samples using microarray technology. One of the shortcomings of microarray data is that they provide a small quantity of samples with respect to the number of genes. This problem reduces the classification accuracy of the methods, so gene selection is essential to improve the predictive accuracy and to identify potential marker genes for a disease. Among numerous existing methods for gene selection, support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVMRFE) has become one of the leading methods, but its performance can be reduced because of the small sample size, noisy data and the fact that the method does not remove redundant genes.",2011-04-19,"Colonic Neoplasms, Data Mining, Gene Expression, Genes, Humans, Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse, Male, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Prostatic Neoplasms, Software",BMC Med Genomics,,Mohammadi
24587403,Identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression normalization in qRT-PCR analysis in watermelon.,"Watermelon is one of the major Cucurbitaceae crops and the recent availability of genome sequence greatly facilitates the fundamental researches on it. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the preferred method for gene expression analyses, and using validated reference genes for normalization is crucial to ensure the accuracy of this method. However, a systematic validation of reference genes has not been conducted on watermelon. In this study, transcripts of 15 candidate reference genes were quantified in watermelon using qRT-PCR, and the stability of these genes was compared using geNorm and NormFinder. geNorm identified ClTUA and ClACT, ClEF1α and ClACT, and ClCAC and ClTUA as the best pairs of reference genes in watermelon organs and tissues under normal growth conditions, abiotic stress, and biotic stress, respectively. NormFinder identified ClYLS8, ClUBCP, and ClCAC as the best single reference genes under the above experimental conditions, respectively. ClYLS8 and ClPP2A were identified as the best reference genes across all samples. Two to nine reference genes were required for more reliable normalization depending on the experimental conditions. The widely used watermelon reference gene 18SrRNA was less stable than the other reference genes under the experimental conditions. Catalase family genes were identified in watermelon genome, and used to validate the reliability of the identified reference genes. ClCAT1and ClCAT2 were induced and upregulated in the first 24 h, whereas ClCAT3 was downregulated in the leaves under low temperature stress. However, the expression levels of these genes were significantly overestimated and misinterpreted when 18SrRNA was used as a reference gene. These results provide a good starting point for reference gene selection in qRT-PCR analyses involving watermelon.

29462160,Identifying potential maternal genes of Bombyx mori using digital gene expression profiling.,"Maternal genes present in mature oocytes play a crucial role in the early development of silkworm. Although maternal genes have been widely studied in many other species, there has been limited research in Bombyx mori. High-throughput next generation sequencing provides a practical method for gene discovery on a genome-wide level. Herein, a transcriptome study was used to identify maternal-related genes from silkworm eggs. Unfertilized eggs from five different stages of early development were used to detect the changing situation of gene expression. The expressed genes showed different patterns over time. Seventy-six maternal genes were annotated according to homology analysis with Drosophila melanogaster. More than half of the differentially expressed maternal genes fell into four expression patterns, while the expression patterns showed a downward trend over time. The functional annotation of these material genes was mainly related to transcription factor activity, growth factor activity, nucleic acid binding, RNA binding, ATP binding, and ion binding. Additionally, twenty-two gene clusters including maternal genes were identified from 18 scaffolds. Altogether, we plotted a profile for the maternal genes of Bombyx mori using a digital gene expression profiling method. This will provide the basis for maternal-specific signature research and improve the understanding of the early development of silkworm.",2018-04-25,"Animals, Bombyx, Drosophila melanogaster, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Genomic Imprinting, Maternal Inheritance, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",PLoS One,,Zhang
28516231,Molecular evolution of type II MAGE genes from ancestral MAGED2 gene and their phylogenetic resolution of basal mammalian clades.,"Type II melanoma-associated antigens (MAGE) are a subgroup of about a dozen proteins found in various locations in the genome and expressed in normal tissues, thus are not related to cancer as the type I MAGE genes. This gene family exists as a single copy in non-mammals and monotremata, but found as two copies in metatherians and occur as a diverse group in all eutherians. Our studies suggest MAGED2 as the ancestor of this subfamily and the most likely evolutionary history of eutherian type II MAGE genes is hereby proposed based on synteny conservation, phylogenetic relations, genome location, homology conservation, and the protein and gene structures. Type II genes can be divided into two: those with 13 exons (MAGED1, MAGED2, TRO, and MAGED4) and those with only one exon (MAGEE1, MAGEE2, MAGEF1, NSMCE3, MAGEH1, MAGEL2, and NDN) with different evolutionary patterns. Our results suggest a need to change the gene nomenclature to MAGE1 (the ancestral gene), currently designated as LOC103095671 and LOC100935086, in opossum and Tasmanian devil, respectively, and MAGE2 (the duplicated one), currently designated as LOC100617402 and NDNL2, respectively, to avoid confusion. We reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships among 23 mammalian species using the combined sequences of MAGED1, MAGED2, MAGEL2, and NDN, because of their high divergence, and found high levels of support, being able to resolve the phylogenetic relationships among Euarchontoglires, Laurasiatheria, Afrotheria, and Xenarthra, as an example that small, but phylogenetically informative sequences, can be very useful for resolving basal mammalian clades.",2018-10-01,"Animals, Antigens, Neoplasm, Eutheria, Evolution, Molecular, Exons, Gene Duplication, Genetic Markers, Genome, Mammals, Melanoma-Specific Antigens, Phylogeny, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Sequence Analysis, Protein, Synteny",Mamm Genome,,De Donato

Compared with studies of common livestock, fewer studies of genes related to the fertility of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) have been reported, and the molecular mechanism of their high productivity is still poorly understood. To identify candidate genes associated with development and prolificacy in rabbits, we analyzed gene expression differences among the ovaries of mature Californian rabbit (LC), and mature (HH) and immature Harbin white rabbit (IH) using digital gene expression technology. We detected 885 and 321 genes that were significantly differentially expressed in comparisons between HH/IH and HH/LC, respectively. The functions of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined by GO classification and KEGG pathway analysis. The results suggest that most of the DEGs between the mature and immature developmental stages were predominantly associated with DNA replication, cell cycle, and progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, and most were up-regulated in the IH group compared with the HH group. The DEGs involved in disparate fecundities between HH and LC were associated with reproduction, fructose and mannose metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and pyruvate metabolism. Our results will contribute to a better understanding of changes in the regulatory network in ovary at different developmental stages and in different fertility of rabbit.",2018-10-24,"Animals, Female, Fertility, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Regulatory Networks, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Microarray Analysis, Oogenesis, Ovary, Rabbits, Reproduction, Transcriptome",Genes Genomics,,Huang

29253611,Biomarker identification in clear cell renal cell carcinoma based on miRNA-seq and digital gene expression-seq data.,"This study aimed to explore the underlying microRNA (miRNA) targets in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The expression profile with accession number GSE24952 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Based on the dataset, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and miRNAs in ccRCC tissues and matched normal adjacent tissues were analyzed. The target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were then predicted. Expression levels of several key miRNAs and genes were detected by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). A total of 168 up- and 288 downregulated DEGs, and 26 up- and 54 downregulated differentially expressed miRNAs were identified. The target genes of miRNA-429 (TGFB1, CCND1, EGFR, and LAMC1) and miRNA-206 (CCND1 and EGFR) were upregulated. Based on the tumor suppressor (TS) gene and tumor-associated gene (TAG) databases, miRNA-142-5p was selected from the upregulated miRNAs. miRNA-429, miRNA-422a, miRNA-206, miRNA-132-3p, and miRNA-184 were selected from the downregulated miRNAs. Moreover, the miRNA regulation network revealed that CCND1 was the common target gene of miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184, and ATP1B1 was the common target gene of miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p. qRT-PCR revealed that the expression levels of miR-140-3p and CCND1 significantly increased, while that of ATP1B1 significantly decreased in 786-O cells compared with those in human renal tubular epithelial cells, which was in accordance with the predicted results of bioinformatic analysis. In conclusion, miRNA-429, miRNA-206, and miRNA-184 and their target gene CCND1, as well as miRNA-140-3p and miRNA-142-5p and their target gene ATP1B1, might play key roles in ccRCC progression and could be useful biomarkers during ccRCC development.",2018-02-09,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Carcinoma, Renal Cell, Cell Line, Tumor, Computational Biology, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Neoplasm, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms, MicroRNAs, Up-Regulation",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.12.031,Guan

27704223,Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis Reveals the Correlation Patterns Among Genes in Euryhaline Adaptation of Crassostrea gigas.,"The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas is a dominant aquaculture species in many intertidal zones throughout the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and can tolerate a wide range of salinity. Studying the gene expression profiles of oyster gills had found differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in salinity tolerance. A systematic study of cellular response to salinity stress may provide insights into the mechanism of acquired salinity tolerance. Here, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was carried out using RNA-seq data from gill transcriptome in response to different salinity. A total of 25,463 genes were parsed into 22 gene modules, of which 5 gene modules were identified as salinity-related modules. Brown module was the only one significantly correlated with salinity and free amino acids (FAAs) contents, which was associated with cellular metabolism, biosynthesis of amino acids, oxidation reduction, electron transport, nitrogen compound metabolism, and others. The enriched pathways in brown module were mainly about FAAs metabolism. The other four modules were significantly correlated with certain FAAs, and were over-represented in certain salinity. These results indicated that C. gigas triggered different FAAs in different salinity stress. This study represents the first RNA-seq gene network analysis in oysters responding to different salinity stresses. These results provide a systems-level framework to help understand the complexity of cellular process in response to osmotic stress and show the function and regulated genes of different FAAs at the molecular level.",2017-04-24,"Amino Acids, Animals, Aquaculture, Crassostrea, Electron Transport, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Multigene Family, Osmotic Pressure, Oxidation-Reduction, Salinity, Salt Tolerance, Sequence Analysis, RNA",Mar Biotechnol (NY),,Zhao

The human genes configuring pseudogenes are also now coming forth as important resources in the study of human protein evolution. In this communication, we explored evolutionary conservation of the genes forming pseudogenes over the genes lacking any pseudogene and delving deeper, we probed an evolutionary rate difference between the disease genes in the two groups. We illustrated this differential evolutionary pattern by gene expressivity, number of regulatory miRNA targeting per gene, abundance of protein complex forming genes and lesser percentage of protein intrinsic disorderness. Furthermore, pseudogenes are observed to harbor sequence variations, over their entirety, those become degenerative disease-causing mutations though the disease involvement of their progenitors is still unexplored. Here, we unveiled an immense association of disease genes in the genes casting pseudogenes in human. We interpreted the issue by disease associated miRNA targeting, genes containing polymorphisms in miRNA target sites, abundance of genes having disease causing non-synonymous mutations, disease gene specific network properties, presence of genes having repeat regions, affluence of dosage sensitive genes and the presence of intrinsically unstructured protein regions.",2012-07-19,"Biological Evolution, Genetic Association Studies, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genome, Human, Humans, Polymorphism, Genetic, Pseudogenes",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2012.04.013,Sen

MATERIAL AND METHODS To reveal the genomic loci underlying keratitis, we performed functional annotations of SNP-based and gene-based genome-wide association studies of keratitis in the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort with 337 199 subjects of European ancestry. RESULTS The publicly available SNP-based association results showed a total of 34 SNPs, from 14 distinct loci, associated with keratitis in the UKB. Gene-based association analysis identified 2 significant genes: IQCF3 (p=2.0×10⁻⁶) and SOD3 (p=2.0×10⁻⁶). Thirty-two candidate genes were then prioritized using information from multiple sources. The overlap of IQCF3 in these 2 analyses resulted in a total of 33 hub genes. Functional annotation of hub genes was performed and transcriptional factors of IQCF3 and SOD3 were predicted. CONCLUSIONS A total of 34 SNPs from 14 distinct loci were identified as being associated with keratitis, and 32 candidate genes were then prioritized. In addition, IQCF3 and SOD3 were identified by their p values through gene-based tests on the basis of individual SNP-based tests.

27259662,Old genes experience stronger translational selection than young genes.,"Selection on synonymous codon usage for translation efficiency and/or accuracy has been identified as a widespread mechanism in many living organisms. However, it remains unknown whether translational selection associates closely with gene age and acts differentially on genes with different evolutionary ages. To address this issue, here we investigate the strength of translational selection acting on different aged genes in human. Our results show that old genes present stronger translational selection than young genes, demonstrating that translational selection correlates positively with gene age. We further explore the difference of translational selection in duplicates vs. singletons and in housekeeping vs. tissue-specific genes. We find that translational selection acts comparably in old singletons and old duplicates and stronger translational selection in old genes is contributed primarily by housekeeping genes. For young genes, contrastingly, singletons experience stronger translational selection than duplicates, presumably due to redundant function of duplicated genes during their early evolutionary stage. Taken together, our results indicate that translational selection acting on a gene would not be constant during all stages of evolution, associating closely with gene age.

31390541,Sequencing of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes and screening of reference genes in leaves of four dominant subtropical forest tree species.,"The young leaves generally accumulate a certain concentration anthocyanins in the dominant species of the subtropical forest, and the changes of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes expression levels had an important effect on the study photoprotection of anthocyanins in the young leaves of subtropical forests. The determination of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme gene sequences and the selection of appropriate reference genes provide a basis for analyzing the functional properties of anthocyanins. In this study, four dominant subtropical forest species (i.e., Schima superba, Castanopsis fissa, Acmena acuminatissima, Cryptocarya concinna) were taken as materials. To obtain the correct nucleotide sequences of anthocyanin-related enzymes, the nucleotide sequences of CHS, DFR and ANS in each dominant species were obtained by sequencing and comparison. Then, to select the most stable reference genes for leaves at different developmental stages and different light conditions, the expression levels of six reference genes, including 18S, Actin, GAPDH, TUB, EF1 and UBQ, were studied by real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR), and reference gene stability was analyzed by GeNorm and NormFinder software. The results showed that the expression level of Actin was the most stable in S. superba, A. acuminatissima and C. concinna, and the expression level of GAPDH was the most stable in C. fissa. Finally, the expression levels of the anthocyanin synthesis genes CHS, DFR and ANS were analyzed and found to be consistent with the accumulation trend of anthocyanins in leaves. This study has important theoretical and practical significance for future research into the expression of anthocyanin synthesis-related enzyme genes in the dominant tree species in subtropical forests and reveals that anthocyanin has a photoprotective effect for young leaves in high-light environments.",2019-09-03,"Acyltransferases, Alcohol Oxidoreductases, Anthocyanins, Forests, Genes, Plant, Plant Leaves, RNA, Plant, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Sequence Alignment, Sequence Analysis, Trees",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144024,Yu

30917603,Does the Presence of Transposable Elements Impact the Epigenetic Environment of Human Duplicated Genes?,"Epigenetic modifications have an important role to explain part of the intra- and inter-species variation in gene expression. They also have a role in the control of transposable elements (TEs) whose activity may have a significant impact on genome evolution by promoting various mutations, which are expected to be mostly deleterious. A change in the local epigenetic landscape associated with the presence of TEs is expected to affect the expression of neighboring genes since these modifications occurring at TE sequences can spread to neighboring sequences. In this work, we have studied how the epigenetic modifications of genes are conserved and what the role of TEs is in this conservation. For that, we have compared the conservation of the epigenome associated with human duplicated genes and the differential presence of TEs near these genes. Our results show higher epigenome conservation of duplicated genes from the same family when they share similar TE environment, suggesting a role for the differential presence of TEs in the evolutionary divergence of duplicates through variation in the epigenetic landscape.",2020-01-09,"DNA Transposable Elements, Epigenesis, Genetic, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Duplicate, Humans, Multigene Family",Genes (Basel),,Lannes

In this milieu, we have used an integrated bioinformatics approach assimilating information from gene ontologies (GO), protein-protein interaction (PPI) and network analysis to predict candidate genes related to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A total of 40973 PPIs were considered for 4704 cancer-related genes to construct human cancer gene network (HCGN). The importance of each node was measured in HCGN by ten different centrality measures. We have shown that the top ranking genes are related to a significantly higher number of diseases as compared to other genes in HCGN. A total of 39 candidate oral cancer target genes were predicted by combining top ranked genes and the genes corresponding to significantly enriched oral cancer related GO terms. Initial verification using literature and available experimental data indicated that 29 genes were related with OSCC. A detailed pathway analysis led us to propose a role for the selected candidate genes in the invasion and metastasis in OSCC. We further validated our predictions using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and found that the gene FLNA was upregulated while the genes ARRB1 and HTT were downregulated in the OSCC tissue samples.",2018-12-13,"Carcinoma, Squamous Cell, Computational Biology, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Ontology, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Mouth Neoplasms, Protein Interaction Maps, Software",Sci Rep,,Kumar
23784086,Key genes and pathways in thyroid cancer based on gene set enrichment analysis.,"The incidence of thyroid cancer and its associated morbidity has shown the most rapid increase among all cancers since 1982, but the mechanisms involved in thyroid cancer, particularly significant key genes induced in thyroid cancer, remain undefined. In many studies, gene probes have been used to search for key genes involved in causing and facilitating thyroid cancer. As a result, many possible virulence genes and pathways have been identified. However, these studies lack a case contrast for selecting the most possible virulence genes and pathways, as well as conclusive results with which to clarify the mechanisms of cancer development. In the present study, we used gene set enrichment and meta-analysis to select key genes and pathways. Based on gene set enrichment, we identified 5 downregulated and 4 upregulated mixed pathways in 6 tissue datasets. Based on the meta-analysis, there were 17 common pathways in the tissue datasets. One pathway, the p53 signaling pathway, which includes 13 genes, was identified by both the gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis. Genes are important elements that form key pathways.

All or nearly all genes can ultimately be associated with a gene model. However, many gene models appear to play little or no role in the traits of an organism. A range of structural, molecular, population and evolutionary features all show a separation between genes with known phenotypes and the overall set of annotated gene models. These different features could be combined to develop models to distinguish the genes that determine the traits of plants from the subset gene other annotated gene models which are unlikely to play a role in doing so.

29067091,Identifying key genes in glaucoma based on a benchmarked dataset and the gene regulatory network.,"The current study aimed to identify key genes in glaucoma based on a benchmarked dataset and gene regulatory network (GRN). Local and global noise was added to the gene expression dataset to produce a benchmarked dataset. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between patients with glaucoma and normal controls were identified utilizing the Linear Models for Microarray Data (Limma) package based on benchmarked dataset. A total of 5 GRN inference methods, including Zscore, GeneNet, context likelihood of relatedness (CLR) algorithm, Partial Correlation coefficient with Information Theory (PCIT) and GEne Network Inference with Ensemble of Trees (Genie3) were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision and recall (PR) curves. The interference method with the best performance was selected to construct the GRN. Subsequently, topological centrality (degree, closeness and betweenness) was conducted to identify key genes in the GRN of glaucoma. Finally, the key genes were validated by performing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). A total of 176 DEGs were detected from the benchmarked dataset. The ROC and PR curves of the 5 methods were analyzed and it was determined that Genie3 had a clear advantage over the other methods; thus, Genie3 was used to construct the GRN.

29113238,Selection of reference genes for gene expression studies in human bladder cancer using SYBR-Green quantitative polymerase chain reaction.,"Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a rapid, reliable and widely used method of studying gene expression profiles that requires appropriate normalization for accurate and reliable results. Reference genes are usually used to normalize mRNA levels; however, the expression levels of these reference genes may vary between cell types, developmental stages, species and experimental conditions. Therefore, a normalization strategy is an important precondition for reliable conclusions, with endogenous controls requiring determination for every experimental system. In the present study, 18 reference genes used in various prior studies were analyzed to determine their applicability in bladder cancer. A total of 35 matched malignant and non-malignant bladder cancer (specifically transitional cell carcinoma) tissue specimens were examined. RNA and cDNA quality was stringently controlled. Candidate reference genes were assessed using SYBR-Green RT-qPCR. mRNA abundance was compared and reference genes with distinct ranges of expression to possible target genes were excluded. Genes that were differentially expressed in matched non-cancerous and cancerous samples were also excluded, using quantification cycle analysis. Subsequently, the stability of the selected reference genes was analyzed using three different methods: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. The rarely used ribosomal protein S23 (RPS23) was the most stable single reference gene, with RPS23, tumor protein, translationally controlled 1 and RPS13 comprising the optimal reference gene set for all the bladder samples. These stable reference genes should be employed in normalization and quantification of transcript levels in future expression studies of bladder cancer-associated genes.",,,Oncol Lett,,Zhang
26719042,Microarray-based gene expression profiling reveals genes and pathways involved in the oncogenic function of REG3A on pancreatic cancer cells.,"We previously reported that regenerating islet-derived protein 3 alpha (REG3A) exacerbates pancreatic malignancies. The mechanism of this effect has not been clearly elucidated. Here we first identified key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and signal pathways in the pancreatic cancer cell line SW1990, compared to two control cell lines, by microarray analysis. We then identified key genes and pathways regulated by REG3A or the cytokine IL6 in SW1990 cells. Afterwards, these DEGs induced by REG3A or IL6 were subjected to KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and GO function analysis by the DAVID online tool. Ultimately, we constructed protein-protein interaction networks among the DEGs by Cytoscape. Among the three pancreatic cell lines, SW1990 exhibited highly deterioration with the activation of genes and pathways related to proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and invasion. As a result, 50 DEGs enriched in 11 pathways were identified in REG3A-treated SW1990 cells, and 28 DEGs enriched in 9 pathways were detected in IL6-treated cells. Overall, results of microarray analysis followed by qRT-PCR and Western blotting suggest that REG3A regulates pancreatic cell growth by increasing the expression of at least 8 genes: JAK1, STAT3, IL10, FOXM1, KRAS, MYC, CyclinD1, and c-fos; and activation of at least 4 signal pathways: TGFβ, PDGF, angiogenesis and RAS. Similar results were obtained with IL6 treatment. Regulation network analysis confirmed the cell growth related DEGs, and further uncovered three transcription factor families with immune functions regulated by REG3A.

26154104,A Genome-Wide Association Study for Culm Cellulose Content in Barley Reveals Candidate Genes Co-Expressed with Members of the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE A Gene Family.,"Cellulose is a fundamentally important component of cell walls of higher plants. It provides a scaffold that allows the development and growth of the plant to occur in an ordered fashion. Cellulose also provides mechanical strength, which is crucial for both normal development and to enable the plant to withstand both abiotic and biotic stresses. We quantified the cellulose concentration in the culm of 288 two--rowed and 288 six--rowed spring type barley accessions that were part of the USDA funded barley Coordinated Agricultural Project (CAP) program in the USA. When the population structure of these accessions was analysed we identified six distinct populations, four of which we considered to be comprised of a sufficient number of accessions to be suitable for genome-wide association studies (GWAS). These lines had been genotyped with 3072 SNPs so we combined the trait and genetic data to carry out GWAS. The analysis allowed us to identify regions of the genome containing significant associations between molecular markers and cellulose concentration data, including one region cross-validated in multiple populations. To identify candidate genes we assembled the gene content of these regions and used these to query a comprehensive RNA-seq based gene expression atlas. This provided us with gene annotations and associated expression data across multiple tissues, which allowed us to formulate a supported list of candidate genes that regulate cellulose biosynthesis. Several regions identified by our analysis contain genes that are co-expressed with cellulose synthase A (HvCesA) across a range of tissues and developmental stages. These genes are involved in both primary and secondary cell wall development. In addition, genes that have been previously linked with cellulose synthesis by biochemical methods, such as HvCOBRA, a gene of unknown function, were also associated with cellulose levels in the association panel. Our analyses provide new insights into the genes that contribute to cellulose content in cereal culms and to a greater understanding of the interactions between them.",2016-04-19,"Agriculture, Cell Wall, Cellulose, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Genetic Markers, Genetics, Population, Genome-Wide Association Study, Genotype, Glucosyltransferases, Glycoside Hydrolases, Hordeum, Linkage Disequilibrium, Multigene Family, Phenotype, Quantitative Trait Loci, Sequence Analysis, RNA, United States",PLoS One,,Houston

28944885,Exploring the key genes and pathways of osteosarcoma with pulmonary metastasis using a gene expression microarray.,"Osteosarcoma is a common and highly malignant tumour in children and teenagers that is characterized by drug resistance and high metastatic potential. Patients often develop pulmonary metastasis and have a low survival rate. However, the mechanistic basis for pulmonary metastasis remains unclear. To identify key gene and pathways associated with pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma, the authors downloaded the gene expression dataset GSE85537 and obtained the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by analyzing high‑throughput gene expression in primary tumours and lung metastases. Subsequently, the authors performed gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway (KEGG) enrichment analyses and a protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and analyzed by Cytoscape software. In total, 2,493 genes were identified as DEGs. Of these, 485 genes (19.45%) were upregulated, and the remaining 2,008 genes (80.55%) were downregulated. The authors identified the predominant GO categories and KEGG pathways that were significantly over‑represented in the metastatic OS samples compared with the non‑metastatic OS samples. A PPI network was constructed, and the results indicated that ALB, EGFR, INS, IL6, CDH1, FYN, ERBB2, IL8, CXCL12 and RAC2 were the top 10 core genes. The enrichment analyses of the genes involved in the top three signiﬁcant modules demonstrated that the DEGs were principally related to neuroactive ligand‑receptor interaction, the Rap1 signaling pathway, and protein digestion and absorption. Together, these data elucidated the molecular mechanisms of OS patients with pulmonary metastasis and provide potential therapeutic targets.

An example is the gene celA (ANIA_08444) encoding a putative mixed linkage glucan synthase. To characterize the role of celA, we deleted it in A. nidulans, analyzed the phenotype of the mycelium and performed RNA-Seq. The strain shows a very strong phenotype, namely ""balloons"" along the hyphae and aberrant conidiophores, as well as an altered susceptibility to cell wall drugs. These data suggest a potential role of the gene in cell wall-related processes. The Gene Ontology term Enrichment analysis shows increased expression of secondary metabolite biosynthetic genes (sterigmatocystin in particular) in the deleted strain.

29556740,Horizontal Gene Transfer Building Prokaryote Genomes: Genes Related to Exchange Between Cell and Environment are Frequently Transferred.,"Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has a major impact on the evolution of prokaryotic genomes, as it allows genes evolved in different contexts to be combined in a single genome, greatly enhancing the ways evolving organisms can explore the gene content space and adapt to the environment. A systematic analysis of HGT in a large number of genomes is of key importance in understanding the impact of HGT in the evolution of prokaryotes. We developed a method for the detection of genes that potentially originated by HGT based on the comparison of BLAST scores between homologous genes to 16S rRNA-based phylogenetic distances between the involved organisms. The approach was applied to 697 prokaryote genomes and estimated that in average approximately 15% of the genes in prokaryote genomes originated by HGT, with a clear correlation between the proportion of predicted HGT genes and the size of the genome. The methodology was strongly supported by evolutionary relationships, as tested by the direct phylogenetic reconstruction of many of the HGT candidates. Studies performed with Escherichia coli W3110 genome clearly show that HGT proteins have fewer interactions when compared to those predicted as vertical inherited, an indication that the number of protein partners imposes limitations to horizontal transfer. A detailed functional classification confirms that genes related to protein translation are vertically inherited, whereas interestingly, transport and binding proteins are strongly enriched among HGT genes. Because these genes are related to the cell exchange with their environment, their transfer most likely contributed to successful adaptation throughout evolution.",2019-07-08,"Bacteria, Escherichia coli, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genome, Bacterial, Phylogeny, Prokaryotic Cells, RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",J Mol Evol,,Paquola

The underlying mechanism associated with SCI-induced immune suppression is still unclear. Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) is now widely applied for the identification of the coexpressed modules, hub genes, and pathways associated with clinic traits of diseases. We performed this study to identify hub genes associated with SCI development. Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data sets GSE45006 and GSE20907 were downloaded and the significant correlativity and connectivity between them were detected using WGCNA. Three significant consensus modules, including 567 eigengenes, were identified from the master GSE45006 data following the preconditions of approximate scale-free topology for WGCNA. Further bioinformatics analysis showed these eigengenes were involved in inflammatory and immune responses in SCI. Three hub genes Rac2, Itgb2, and Tyrobp and one pathway ""natural killer cell-mediated cytotoxicity"" were identified following short time-series expression miner, protein-protein interaction network, and functional enrichment analysis. Gradually upregulated expression patterns of Rac2, Itgb2, and Tyrobp genes at 0, 3, 7, and 14 days after SCI were confirmed based on GSE45006 and GSE20907 data set.

Identification for the potential biomarkers of PTC may contribute to early discovery of recurrence and treatment. In The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we obtained the information of RNA sequence data and clinical characteristics of PTC. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to construct gene co-expression networks and investigate the relationship between modules and clinical traits. Finally, we constructed 16 co-expression modules in 10,428 genes, and three key modules (darkturquoise, lightyellow, and red) associated with tumor N grade were identified. The results of functional annotation indicated that the darkturquoise module was primarily enriched in the regulation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), collagen metabolism, and cell adhesion, the lightyellow module was primarily enriched in the mitochondrial function regulation and energy synthesis, and the red module was primarily enriched in the process of cell junction, apoptosis, and inflammatory response, suggesting their significant role in the progression of PTC. In addition, the hub genes in the three modules were identified and screened for differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Relapse-free survival analyses found that 11 genes (KCNQ3, MET, FN1, ITGA3, RUNX1, ITGA2, PERP, GCSH, FAAH, NGFRAP1, and HSPA5) may play a pivotal role in PTC relapse.

29190793,Transcriptome analysis of WRKY gene family in Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt and WRKY genes involved in responses to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae stress.,"Oryza officinalis Wall ex Watt, a very important and special wild rice species, shows abundant genetic diversity and disease resistance features, especially high resistance to bacterial blight. The molecular mechanisms of bacterial blight resistance in O. officinalis have not yet been elucidated. The WRKY transcription factor family is one of the largest gene families involved in plant growth, development and stress response. However, little is known about the numbers, structure, molecular phylogenetics, and expression of the WRKY genes under Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) stress in O. officinalis due to lacking of O. officinalis genome. Therefore, based on the RNA-sequencing data of O. officinalis, we performed a comprehensive study of WRKY genes in O. officinalis and identified 89 OoWRKY genes. Then 89 OoWRKY genes were classified into three groups based on the WRKY domains and zinc finger motifs. Phylogenetic analysis strongly supported that the evolution of OoWRKY genes were consistent with previous studies of WRKYs, and subgroup IIc OoWRKY genes were the original ancestors of some group II and group III OoWRKYs. Among the 89 OoWRKY genes, eight OoWRKYs displayed significantly different expression (>2-fold, p<0.01) in the O. officinalis transcriptome under Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress 48 h, suggesting these genes might play important role in PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O. officinalis. QRT-PCR analysis and confirmation of eight OoWRKYs expression patterns revealed that they responded strongly to PXO99 and C5 stress 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h, and the trends of these genes displaying marked changes were consistent with the 48 h RNA-sequencing data, demonstrated these genes played important roles in response to biotic stress and might even involved in the bacterial blight resistance. Tissue expression profiles of eight OoWRKY genes revealed that they were highly expressed in root, stem, leaf, and flower, especially in leaf (except OoWRKY71), suggesting these genes might be also important for plant growth and organ development. In this study, we analyzed the WRKY family of transcription factors in O.officinalis. Insight was gained into the classification, evolution, and function of the OoWRKY genes, revealing the putative roles of eight significantly different expression OoWRKYs in Xoo strains PXO99 and C5 stress responses in O.officinalis.

The raw dataset GSE75436 was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 15 IA samples and 15 matched superficial temporal artery (STA) samples. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package in R software. Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed on the DEGs using the gplot2 package in R. Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online tools were used to perform gene ontology (GO) functional enrichment analysis. DAVID and gene set enrichment analysis were separately used to perform the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. The intersections of the two results were selected as common KEGG pathways. Protein‑protein interaction (PPI) analysis among the DEGs involved in the common KEGG pathways was performed using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes online tools, and visualized with Cytoscape software. A total of 782 DEGs were identified, comprising 392 upregulated and 390 downregulated DEGs. Hierarchical clustering demonstrated that the DEGs could precisely distinguish the IAs from the STAs. The GO enrichment analysis demonstrated that the upregulated DEGs were mainly involved in the inflammatory response and the management of extracellular matrix, and the downregulated DEGs were mainly involved in the process of vascular smooth muscle contraction. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis demonstrated that the common pathways were 'leishmaniasis', 'Toll‑like receptor signaling pathway' and 'vascular smooth muscle contraction'.

24509829,Validation of reference genes in Penicillium echinulatum to enable gene expression study using real-time quantitative RT-PCR.,"Quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a methodology that facilitates the quantification of mRNA expression in a given sample. Analysis of relative gene expression by qRT-PCR requires normalization of the data using a reference gene that is expressed at a similar level in all evaluated conditions. Determining an internal control gene is essential for gene expression studies. Gene expression studies in filamentous fungi frequently use the β-actin gene (actb), β-tubulin, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as reference genes because they are known to have consistent expression levels. Until now, no study has been performed to select an internal control gene for the filamentous fungal species Penicillium echinulatum. The aim of this study was to evaluate and validate internal control genes to enable the study of gene expression in P. echinulatum using qRT-PCR. P. echinulatum strain S1M29 was grown in conditions to either induce (cellulose and sugar cane bagasse) or repress (glucose) gene expression to analyze 23 candidate normalization genes for stable expression. Two software programs, BestKeeper and geNorm, were used to assess the expression of the candidate normalization genes.

29152649,Identification of key genes in glioma CpG island methylator phenotype via network analysis of gene expression data.,"Gene expression data were analysed using bioinformatic tools to demonstrate molecular mechanisms underlying the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). A gene expression data set (accession no. GSE30336) was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus, including 36 CIMP+ and 16 CIMP- glioma samples. Differential analysis was performed for CIMP+ vs. CIMP‑ samples using the limma package in R. Functional enrichment analysis was subsequently conducted for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integration Discovery. Protein‑protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed for upregulated and downregulated genes with information from STRING. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) targeting DEGs were also predicted using WebGestalt. A total of 439 DEGs were identified, including 214 upregulated and 198 downregulated genes. The upregulated genes were involved in extracellular matrix organisation, defence and immune response, collagen fibril organisation and regulation of cell motion and the downregulated genes in cell adhesion, sensory organ development, regulation of system process, neuron differentiation and membrane organisation. A PPI network containing 134 nodes and 314 edges was constructed from the upregulated genes, whereas a PPI network consisting of 85 nodes and 80 edges was obtained from the downregulated genes. miRNAs regulating upregulated and downregulated genes were predicted, including miRNA‑124a and miRNA‑34a. Numerous key genes associated with glioma CIMP were identified in the present study. These findings may advance the understanding of glioma and facilitate the development of appropriate therapies.",2018-07-20,"CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Glioma, Humans, MicroRNAs, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps",Mol Med Rep,,Bo
32184169,Bioinformatics analysis reveals novel core genes associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most frequent liver disease and associated with a wide spectrum of hepatic disorders ranging from nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). NASH is projected to become the most common indication for liver transplantation, and the annual incidence rate of NASH-related HCC is 5.29 cases per 1000 person-years. Owing to the epidemics of NAFLD and the unclear mechanism of NAFLD progression, it is important to elucidate the underlying NAFLD mechanisms in detail. NASH is mainly caused by the development of NAFL Therefore, it is also of great significance to understand the mechanism of progression from NAFL to NASH. Gene expression chip data for NAFLD and NASH were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between NAFLD and normal controls (called DEGs for NAFLD), as well as between NASH and normal tissue (called DEGs for NASH-Normal), and between NASH and NAFL tissue (called DEGs for NASH-NAFL). For DEGs for the NAFLD group, key genes were identified by studying the form of intersection. Potential functions of DEGs for NASH were then analyzed by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. A protein-protein interaction network (PPI) was constructed using the STRING database. A total of 249 DEGs and one key gene for NAFLD were identified. For NASH-Normal, 514 DEGs and 11 hub genes were identified, three of which were closely related to the survival analysis of HCC, and potentially closely related to progression from NASH to HCC. One key gene for NASH-NAFL (AKR1B10) was identified. These genes appear to mediate the molecular mechanism underlying NAFLD and may be promising biomarkers for the presence of NASH.",2020-06-01,"Aldo-Keto Reductases, Biomarkers, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Computational Biology, Datasets as Topic, Diagnosis, Differential, Disease Progression, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Liver Neoplasms, Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Protein Interaction Maps",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2020.144549,Feng

The animal quantitative trait loci (QTL) database is a valuable resource and can be used for interpreting the genetic mechanisms that underlie growth and immune traits. However, QTL intervals often involve too many candidate genes to find the true causal genes. Therefore, the aim of this study was to provide an effective annotation pipeline that can make full use of the information of Gene Ontology terms annotation, linkage gene blocks and pathways to further identify pleiotropic genes and gene sets in the overlapping intervals of growth-related and immunity-related QTLs. In total, 55 non-redundant QTL overlapping intervals were identified, 1893 growth-related genes and 713 immunity-related genes were further classified into overlapping intervals and 405 pleiotropic genes shared by the two gene sets were determined. In addition, 19 pleiotropic gene linkage blocks and 67 pathways related to immunity and growth traits were discovered. A total of 343 growth-related genes and 144 immunity-related genes involved in pleiotropic pathways were also identified, respectively. We also sequenced and genotyped 284 individuals from Chinese Meishan pigs and European pigs and mapped the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to the pleiotropic genes and gene sets that we identified. A total of 971 high-confidence SNPs were mapped to the pleiotropic genes and gene sets that we identified, and among them 743 SNPs were statistically significant in allele frequency between Meishan and European pigs. This study explores the relationship between growth and immunity traits from the view of QTL overlapping intervals and can be generalized to explore the relationships between other traits.

The male sterile (MS) and male fertile (MF) two-type lines of T. erecta have been utilized in F1 hybrid production for many years, but no report has been made to identify the genes that specify its male sterility that is caused by homeotic conversion of floral organs. In this study, transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression profiling were performed to generate expression profiles of MS and MF plants. A cDNA library was generated from an equal mixture of RNA isolated from MS and MF flower buds (1 mm and 4 mm in diameter). Totally, 87,473,431 clean tags were obtained and assembled into 128,937 transcripts among which 65,857 unigenes were identified with an average length of 1,188 bp. About 52% of unigenes (34,176) were annotated in Nr, Nt, Pfam, KOG/COG, Swiss-Prot, KO (KEGG Ortholog database) and/or GO. Taking the above transcriptome as reference, 125 differentially expressed genes were detected in both developmental stages of MS and MF flower buds. MADS-box genes were presumed to be highly related to male sterility in T. erecta based on histological and cytological observations. Twelve MADS-box genes showed significantly different expression levels in flower buds 4 mm in diameter, whereas only one gene expressed significantly different in flower buds 1 mm in diameter between MS and MF plants. This is the first transcriptome analysis in T. erecta and will provide a valuable resource for future genomic studies, especially in flower organ development and/or differentiation.

Since the exact role of Fhl1 in this process was not known, we wanted to identify its downstream targets and to investigate its possible cooperation with another known regulator of sporulation. Gene expression and Northern blot analysis of the fhl1∆ mutant strain revealed the target genes involved in mating and sporulation. Our results also showed that Fhl1 could regulate nutrient sensing, the transporter and permease genes.

31487323,Differential gene expression in bovine endometrial epithelial cells after challenge with LPS; specific implications for genes involved in embryo maternal interactions.,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) expressed on the surface of Gram-negative bacteria activates pro-inflammatory pathways, dys-regulates the function of endometrial cells and is a key player in the mechanisms involved in endometritis. This study aimed to investigate the effects of LPS on bovine endometrial epithelial cells (bEEC) from whole transcriptome with a special focus on genes involved in embryo-maternal interactions. Following in vitro culture, bEEC from three cows were exposed to 0, 2, and 8 μg/mL LPS for 24h. RNA samples extracted at 0 and 24 hours were analyzed by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). At 24h, 2035 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between controls and samples treated with 2 μg/mL LPS. Gene ontology analysis showed that over-expressed DEGs were associated to immune response, response to stress and external stimuli, catalytic activity, and cell cycle. Genes associated with cell membrane and cell adhesion pathways were under-expressed. LPS induced changes in expression of specific genes related to embryo-maternal interactions including under-expression of eight members of the cadherin superfamily, over-expression of six members of the mucin family, and differential expression of a large set of genes binding the above molecules and of more than 20 transcripts coding for cytokines and their receptors. Type I interferon-τ dependent genes were also over-expressed. From a sub-set of 19 genes, (biological replicates of bEEC from cows taken at time 6 (n = 3), 24 (n = 6) and 48 hours (n = 3), and 2 technical replicates per sample) differential gene expression was confirmed by RT2-qPCR (r2 between fold changes at 24 hours by RT2-qPCR and RNA-seq = 0.97). These results indicate that LPS affects the function of bEEC in many ways by differential transcription, glycolytic metabolism and oxidative stress. Many transcriptomic signatures related to implantation and embryo maternal interactions were strongly affected by LPS. These results pave the way for further studies to investigate the duration of these changes and their possible impact on endometrial function and fertility.",2020-03-19,"Animals, Biomarkers, Cattle, Embryo Implantation, Embryo, Mammalian, Endometrium, Epithelial Cells, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Lipopolysaccharides, Transcriptome",PLoS One,,Guo
31013288,Identification of key regulatory genes connected to NF-κB family of proteins in visceral adipose tissues using gene expression and weighted protein interaction network.,"Obesity is connected to the activation of chronic inflammatory pathways in both adipocytes and macrophages located in adipose tissues. The nuclear factor (NF)-κB is a central molecule involved in inflammatory pathways linked to the pathology of different complex metabolic disorders. Investigating the gene expression data in the adipose tissue would potentially unravel disease relevant gene interactions. The present study is aimed at creating a signature molecular network and at prioritizing the potential biomarkers interacting with NF-κB family of proteins in obesity using system biology approaches. The dataset GSE88837 associated with obesity was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Statistical analysis represented the differential expression of a total of 2650 genes in adipose tissues (p = <0.05). Using concepts like correlation, semantic similarity, and theoretical graph parameters we narrowed down genes to a network of 23 genes strongly connected with NF-κB family with higher significance. Functional enrichment analysis revealed 21 of 23 target genes of NF-κB were found to have a critical role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Interestingly, GEM and PPP1R13L were predicted as novel genes which may act as potential target or biomarkers of obesity as they occur with other 21 target genes with known obesity relationship. Our study concludes that NF-κB and prioritized target genes regulate the inflammation in adipose tissues through several molecular signaling pathways like NF-κB, PI3K-Akt, glucocorticoid receptor regulatory network, angiogenesis and cytokine pathways. This integrated system biology approaches can be applied for elucidating functional protein interaction networks of NF-κB protein family in different complex diseases.

28814516,Baculovirus Molecular Evolution via Gene Turnover and Recurrent Positive Selection of Key Genes.,"Hosts and viruses are locked in an evolutionary arms race. Hosts are constantly evolving to suppress virulence and replication, while viruses, which are reliant on host machinery for survival and reproduction, develop counterstrategies to escape this immune defense. Viruses must also adapt to novel conditions while establishing themselves in a host species. Both processes provide strong selection for viral adaptation. Understanding adaptive evolution in insect viruses can help us to better understand adaptive evolution in general and is important due to the use of these viruses as biocontrol agents and for protecting ecologically or economically important species from outbreaks. Here we examine the molecular evolution of baculoviruses and nudiviruses, a group of insect-infecting viruses with key roles in biocontrol. We looked for signatures of selection between genomes of baculoviruses infecting a range of species and within a population of baculoviruses. Both analyses found only a few strong signatures of positive selection, primarily in replication- and transcription-associated genes and several structural protein genes. In both analyses, we detected a conserved complex of genes, including the helicase gene, showing consistently high levels of adaptive evolution, suggesting that they may be key in antagonistic coevolution to escape host suppression. These genes are integral to the baculovirus life cycle and may be good focal genes for developing baculoviruses as effective biocontrol agents or for targeting baculoviruses infecting ecologically relevant species. Recombination and complex genomes make evolution in these double-stranded DNA viruses more efficient than that in smaller RNA viruses with error-prone replication, as seen via signatures of selection in specific genes within a population of baculoviruses.",2017-11-02,"Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Viral, Nucleopolyhedroviruses, Selection, Genetic",J Virol,,Hill
30802965,A two genes - for - one gene interaction between Leptosphaeria maculans and Brassica napus.,"Interactions between Leptosphaeria maculans, causal agent of stem canker of oilseed rape, and its Brassica hosts are models of choice to explore the multiplicity of 'gene-for-gene' complementarities and how they diversified to increased complexity in the course of plant-pathogen co-evolution. Here, we support this postulate by investigating the AvrLm10 avirulence that induces a resistance response when recognized by the Brassica nigra resistance gene Rlm10. Using genome-assisted map-based cloning, we identified and cloned two AvrLm10 candidates as two genes in opposite transcriptional orientation located in a subtelomeric repeat-rich region of the genome. The AvrLm10 genes encode small secreted proteins and show expression profiles in planta similar to those of all L. maculans avirulence genes identified so far. Complementation and silencing assays indicated that both genes are necessary to trigger Rlm10 resistance. Three assays for protein-protein interactions showed that the two AvrLm10 proteins interact physically in vitro and in planta. Some avirulence genes are recognized by two distinct resistance genes and some avirulence genes hide the recognition specificities of another. Our L. maculans model illustrates an additional case where two genes located in opposite transcriptional orientation are necessary to induce resistance. Interestingly, orthologues exist for both L. maculans genes in other phytopathogenic species, with a similar genome organization, which may point to an important conserved effector function linked to heterodimerization of the two proteins.",2020-03-11,"Ascomycota, Brassica napus, Conserved Sequence, DNA, Intergenic, Epistasis, Genetic, Fungal Proteins, Genetic Loci, Genome, Fungal, Phenotype, Physical Chromosome Mapping, Plant Diseases, Protein Binding, Protein Sorting Signals, Virulence",New Phytol,10.1111/nph.15762,Petit-Houdenot

26685675,Characterisation of the genes involved in the biosynthesis and attachment of the aminodeoxysugar D-forosamine in the auricin gene cluster of Streptomyces aureofaciens CCM3239.,"We previously identified the aur1 gene cluster which produces the angucycline antibiotic auricin. Preliminary characterisation of auricin revealed that it is modified by a single aminodeoxysugar, D-forosamine. Here we characterise the D-forosamine-specific genes. The four close tandem genes, aur1TQSV, encoding enzymes involved in the initial steps of the deoxysugar biosynthesis, were located on a large operon with other core auricin biosynthetic genes. Deleting these genes resulted in the absence of auricin and the production of deglycosylated auricin intermediates. The two final D-forosamine biosynthetic genes, sa59, an NDP-hexose aminotransferase, and sa52, an NDP-aminohexose N-dimethyltransferase, are located in a region rather distant from the core auricin genes. A deletion analysis of these genes confirmed their role in D-forosamine biosynthesis. The Δsa59 mutant had a phenotype similar to that of the cluster deletion mutant, while the Δsa52 mutant produced an auricin with a demethylated D-forosamine. Although auricin contains a single deoxyhexose, two glycosyltransferase genes were found to participate in the attachment of D-forosamine to the auricin aglycon. An analysis of the expression of the D-forosamine biosynthesis genes revealed that the initial D-forosamine biosynthetic genes aur1TQSV are regulated together with the other auricin core genes by the aur1Ap promoter under the control of the auricin-specific activator Aur1P. The expression of the other D-forosamine genes, however, is governed by promoters differentially dependent upon the two SARP family auricin-specific activators Aur1PR3 and Aur1PR4. These promoters contain direct repeats similar to the SARP consensus sequence and are involved in the interaction with both regulators.

32422011,Validation of Housekeeping Genes for Gene Expression Profiling in Fish: A Necessity.,"Real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is a reliable tool for gene expression analysis in various organisms. Its use in aquaculture and study of fish physiology is increasing day by day. Relative quantification of mRNA through real-time qPCR requires suitable housekeeping genes/reference genes. Expression of housekeeping genes were thought to be constant in different tissues under various physiological and experimental conditions. In light of the literature reviewed here, it is clear that expression of most of the genes varied in different physiological conditions, under different experimental conditions, and in different gender. Use of housekeeping genes without proper validation may lead to erroneous results and misinterpretation of data. To solve this problem, various types of user-friendly software are now available for validation of housekeeping genes. Moreover, it is recommended to use more than one housekeeping gene for relative quantification. Using the geometric mean of the three most stable genes as a housekeeping gene can also solve this problem to some extent.

30953073,Identification of common highly expressed genes of Salmonella Enteritidis by in silico prediction of gene expression and in vitro transcriptomic analysis.,"Chickens are the reservoir host of Salmonella Enteritidis. Salmonella Enteritidis colonizes the gastro-intestinal tract of chickens and replicates within macrophages without causing clinically discernable illness. Persistence of S. Enteritidis in the hostile environments of intestinal tract and macrophages allows it to disseminate extra-intestinally to liver, spleen, and reproductive tract. Extra-intestinal dissemination into reproductive tract leads to contamination of internal contents of eggs, which is a major risk factor for human infection. Understanding the genes that contribute to S. Enteritidis persistence in the chicken host is central to elucidate the genetic basis of the unique pathobiology of this public health pathogen. The aim of this study was to identify a succinct set of genes associated with infection-relevant in vitro environments to provide a rational foundation for subsequent biologically-relevant research. We used in silico prediction of gene expression and RNA-seq technology to identify a core set of 73 S. Enteritidis genes that are consistently highly expressed in multiple S. Enteritidis strains cultured at avian physiologic temperature under conditions that represent intestinal and intracellular environments. These common highly expressed (CHX) genes encode proteins involved in bacterial metabolism, protein synthesis, cell-envelope biogenesis, stress response, and a few proteins with uncharacterized functions. Further studies are needed to dissect the contribution of these CHX genes to the pathobiology of S. Enteritidis in the avian host. Several of the CHX genes could serve as promising targets for studies towards the development of immunoprophylactic and novel therapeutic strategies to prevent colonization of chickens and their environment with S.

27312952,A functional difference between native and horizontally acquired genes in bdelloid rotifers.,"The form of RNA processing known as SL trans-splicing involves the transfer of a short conserved sequence, the spliced leader (SL), from a noncoding SL RNA to the 5' ends of mRNA molecules. SL trans-splicing occurs in several animal taxa, including bdelloid rotifers (Rotifera, Bdelloidea). One striking feature of these aquatic microinvertebrates is the large proportion of foreign genes, i.e. those acquired by horizontal gene transfer from other organisms, in their genomes. However, whether such foreign genes behave similarly to native genes has not been tested in bdelloids or any other animal. We therefore used a combination of experimental and computational methods to examine whether transcripts of foreign genes in bdelloids were SL trans-spliced, like their native counterparts. We found that many foreign transcripts contain SLs, use similar splice acceptor sequences to native genes, and are able to undergo alternative trans-splicing. However, a significantly lower proportion of foreign mRNAs contains SL sequences than native transcripts. This demonstrates a novel functional difference between foreign and native genes in bdelloids and suggests that SL trans-splicing is not essential for the expression of foreign genes, but is acquired during their domestication.

25721200,Comprehensive selection of reference genes for quantitative gene expression analysis during seed development in Brassica napus.,"MicroRNAs have higher expression stability than protein-coding genes in B. napus seeds and are therefore good reference genes for miRNA and mRNA RT-qPCR analysis. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) has become the ""gold standard"" to gain insight into function of genes. However, the accuracy of the technique depends on appropriate reference genes for quantification analysis in different experimental conditions. Accumulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) has also been studied by RT-qPCR, but there are no reference genes currently validated for normalization of Brassica napus miRNA expression data. In this study, we selected 43 B. napus miRNAs and 18 previously validated mRNA reference genes. The expression stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated in different tissue samples (stages of seed development, flowers, and leaves) using geNorm, NormFinder, and RefFinder analysis. The best-ranked reference genes for expression studies during seed development (miR167-1_2, miR11-1, miR159-1 and miR168-1) were used to asses the expression of miR03-1. Since candidate miRNAs showed higher expression stability than protein-coding genes in most of the tested conditions, the expression profile of DGAT1 gene was compared when normalized by the four most stable miRNAs reference genes and by the four most stable mRNA reference genes. The expected expression pattern of DGAT1 during seed development was achieved with the use of miRNA as reference genes. In conclusion, the most stable miRNA reference genes can be employed in the normalization of RT-qPCR quantification of miRNAs and protein-coding genes.

24260533,Gene-level integrated metric of negative selection (GIMS) prioritizes candidate genes for nephrotic syndrome.,"Nephrotic syndrome (NS) gene discovery efforts are now occurring in small kindreds and cohorts of sporadic cases. Power to identify causal variants in these groups beyond a statistical significance threshold is challenging due to small sample size and/or lack of family information. There is a need to develop novel methods to identify NS-associated variants. One way to determine putative functional relevance of a gene is to measure its strength of negative selection, as variants in genes under strong negative selection are more likely to be deleterious. We created a gene-level, integrated metric of negative selection (GIMS) score for 20,079 genes by combining multiple comparative genomics and population genetics measures. To understand the utility of GIMS for NS gene discovery, we examined this score in a diverse set of NS-relevant gene sets. These included genes known to cause monogenic forms of NS in humans as well as genes expressed in the cells of the glomerulus and, particularly, the podocyte. We found strong negative selection in the following NS-relevant gene sets: (1) autosomal-dominant Mendelian focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) genes (p = 0.03 compared to reference), (2) glomerular expressed genes (p = 4×10(-23)), and (3) predicted podocyte genes (p = 3×10(-9)). Eight genes causing autosomal dominant forms of FSGS had a stronger combined score of negative selection and podocyte enrichment as compared to all other genes (p = 1 x 10(-3)). As a whole, recessive FSGS genes were not enriched for negative selection. Thus, we also created a transcript-level, integrated metric of negative selection (TIMS) to quantify negative selection on an isoform level. These revealed transcripts of known autosomal recessive disease-causing genes that were nonetheless under strong selection. We suggest that a filtering strategy that includes measuring negative selection on a gene or isoform level could aid in identifying NS-related genes.

25063300,Finding pathway-modulating genes from a novel Ontology Fingerprint-derived gene network.,"To enhance our knowledge regarding biological pathway regulation, we took an integrated approach, using the biomedical literature, ontologies, network analyses and experimental investigation to infer novel genes that could modulate biological pathways. We first constructed a novel gene network via a pairwise comparison of all yeast genes' Ontology Fingerprints--a set of Gene Ontology terms overrepresented in the PubMed abstracts linked to a gene along with those terms' corresponding enrichment P-values. The network was further refined using a Bayesian hierarchical model to identify novel genes that could potentially influence the pathway activities. We applied this method to the sphingolipid pathway in yeast and found that many top-ranked genes indeed displayed altered sphingolipid pathway functions, initially measured by their sensitivity to myriocin, an inhibitor of de novo sphingolipid biosynthesis. Further experiments confirmed the modulation of the sphingolipid pathway by one of these genes, PFA4, encoding a palmitoyl transferase. Comparative analysis showed that few of these novel genes could be discovered by other existing methods. Our novel gene network provides a unique and comprehensive resource to study pathway modulations and systems biology in general.",2015-01-15,"Bayes Theorem, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Fungal, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, PubMed, Sphingolipids, Yeasts",Nucleic Acids Res,,Qin

However, these genes have not been extensively studied in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), a model for Solanaceae plants and for fleshy fruit development. Here, we identified and systematically analyzed 38 CesA/Csl family members that contained cellulose synthase domain regions, and categorized their encoded proteins into 6 subfamilies (CesA, CslA, CslB, CslD, CslE, and CslG) based on phylogenetic analysis. Most CesA/Csl genes from tomato are closely related to those from Arabidopsis, but the families have distinct features regarding gene structure, chromosome distribution and localization, phylogeny, and deduced protein sequence, indicating that they arose via different evolutionary process. Furthermore, expression analysis of CesA/Csl genes in different tissues at various developmental stages showed that most CesAs were constitutively expressed with differential expression levels in various organs; three CslD genes were expressed specifically in flowers, and four CesA and five Csl putative genes were preferentially expressed in fruits. Our results provide insight into the general characteristics of the CesA/Csl genes in tomato, and lay the foundation for further functional studies of CesA/Csl genes in tomato and other Solanaceae species.",2019-02-04,"Amino Acid Sequence, Arabidopsis, Cellulose, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Glucosyltransferases, Lycopersicon esculentum, Multigene Family, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Sequence Alignment",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.11.039,Song
30037557,N-terminal engineering of overlapping genes in the nitrile hydratase gene cluster improved its activity.,"Nitrile hydratase which catalyzes the hydration of nitriles to the corresponding amides is operon-encoded. However, when heterologously expressed, genes in the same operon are usually not equally expressed, and the ratio needs to be fine-tuned. A gene cluster of three genes (corresponding to α-subunit, β-subunit and activator) encoding the nitrile hydratase was cloned from Aurantimonas manganoxydans ATCC BAA-1229 and expressed in Escherichia coli. However, difficulty was encountered in heterologous expression of the activator and the expression level of β-subunit was lower than that of α-subunit, which together resulted in low catalytic efficiency. To improve the expression of activator, a set of SKIK tags were fused to the N-terminus of the activator. To elevate the expression level of β-subunit, a silent mutation strategy was applied in the overlapping sequence with α-subunit around its translation initial region. Finally, the expression of β-subunit and activator were improved and the maximum activity of NHase1229 was doubled, reaching 160 U/mL towards 3-cyanopyridine. These results indicate that N-terminal engineering is an efficient strategy for optimizing the expression of multiple genes in operons.",2018-12-27,"Alphaproteobacteria, Base Sequence, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genes, Overlapping, Genetic Engineering, Hydro-Lyases, Multigene Family, Operon, Silent Mutation",Enzyme Microb Technol,10.1016/j.enzmictec.2018.05.015,Yang

31589962,Complete plastome sequencing of Allium paradoxum reveals unusual rearrangements and the loss of the ndh genes as compared to Allium ursinum and other onions.,"In this work the complete chloroplast DNAs of Allium paradoxum and Allium ursinum, two edible species of Allium subg. Amerallium (the first lineage), were sequenced, assembled, annotated, and compared with complete Allium plastomes of the second and third evolutionary lines from GenBank database. The A. ursinum plastome contains 90 predicted genes (81 unique) including 5 pseudogenes, while A. paradoxum has 88 predicted genes (79 unique) including 19 pseudogenes. The comparative analysis has revealed that the A. paradoxum plastome differs markedly from those of other species. Due to many deletions, the A. paradoxum plastome is the shortest of known for Allium species, being only 145,819 bp long. The most prominent distinctions are (1) a 4825 bp long local inversion that spans from the ndhE to the rpl32 gene in the small single copy region and (2) pseudogenization, or the loss of all NADH-genes. In contrast, the plastome of A. ursinum - a species from the first evolutionary line (as well as A. paradoxum) - resembles the Allium species of the second and third evolutionary lines, showing no large rearrangements or discrepancies in gene content. It is unclear yet whether only A. paradoxum was affected by some evolutionary events or its close relatives from both sect. Briseis and other sections of Amerallium were altered as well. We speculate the sunlight-intolerant, shade-loving nature of A. paradoxum and the impairment of the ndh genes in its plastome could be interrelated phenomena.",2020-01-06,"Allium, DNA, Chloroplast, DNA, Plant, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Rearrangement, Genes, Plant, Genome, Chloroplast, Genome, Plant, Onions, Phylogeny, Plant Leaves, Pseudogenes, Sequence Analysis, DNA",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144154,Omelchenko
30872752,Six novel immunoglobulin genes as biomarkers for better prognosis in triple-negative breast cancer by gene co-expression network analysis.,"Gene co-expression network analysis (GCNA) can detect alterations in regulatory activities in case/control comparisons. We propose a framework to detect novel genes and networks for predicting breast cancer recurrence. Thirty-four prognosis candidate genes were selected based on a literature review. Four Gene Expression Omnibus Series (GSE) microarray datasets (n = 920) were used to create gene co-expression networks based on these candidates. We applied the framework to four comparison groups according to node (+/-) and recurrence (+/-). We identified a sub-network containing two candidate genes (LST1 and IGHM) and six novel genes (IGHA1, IGHD, IGHG1, IGHG3, IGLC2, and IGLJ3) related to B cell-specific immunoglobulin. These novel genes were correlated with recurrence under the control of node status and were found to function as tumor suppressors; higher mRNA expression indicated a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, HR = 0.87, p = 0.001). We created an immune index score by performing principle component analysis and divided the genes into low and high groups. This discrete index significantly predicted relapse-free survival (RFS) (high: HR = 0.77, p = 0.019; low: control). Public tool KM Plotter and TCGA-BRCA gene expression data were used to validate. We confirmed these genes are correlated with RFS and distal metastasis-free survival (DMFS) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and general breast cancer.",,,Sci Rep,,Hsu
32390000,Bioinformatics Analysis and High-Throughput Sequencing to Identify Differentially Expressed Genes in Nebulin Gene (NEB) Mutations Mice.,"BACKGROUND High-throughput sequencing of the pathological tissue of 59 patients with thyroid cancer was compared with the normal population. It was found that the mutation frequency of the Nebulin gene (NEB) at amino acid 1133 locus of thyroid cancer patients was much higher than that of the normal population, suggesting that NEB mutation may be related to thyroid cancer. Therefore, we constructed the NEB mutant mice for further investigation. MATERIAL AND METHODS The RNA extracted from the thyroid of wild-type and NEB mutant mice was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing, and the differential expression was analyzed by edgeR software. Several differentially expressed genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) verification, and these genes were analyzed with Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis. RESULTS A total of 624 genes were significantly enriched. Analysis of GO function and pathway significant enrichment showed that differentially expressed genes were enriched in thyroid cancer, myocardial contraction, and autoimmune thyroid disease. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with the high-throughput sequencing results. CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that the expression of some cancer-driving genes and cancer suppressor genes are significantly changed in NEB mutant mice compared to wild-type mice, which suggests that NEB function plays an important role in regulating the expression of cancer-related genes in the thyroid gland.",,,Med Sci Monit,,Wang
27700223,Steroid hormone receptors silence genes by a chromatin-targeted mechanism similar to those used for gene activation.,"How genes are repressed by steroid hormones remains a matter of debate, and several indirect mechanisms have been proposed. We found that the ligand-activated progesterone receptor recruits to the promoter of downregulated genes a repressor complex composed of HP1γ, the lysine demethylase LSD1, histone deacetylases, coREST, the RNA SRA, and the ATPase BRG1. BRG1 is needed for chromatin remodeling and facilitates the deposition of linker histone variant H1.2, which compacts chromatin and hinders RNA polymerase loading and transcription. Thus, steroid hormone receptors can repress genes in ways reminiscent of those used for gene induction, namely by directly targeting factors that remodel chromatin. But while PR-dependent gene induction in T47D cells is mainly achieved by potentiating enhancer activity, repression acts at the level of gene promoters.",2017-10-25,"Animals, Cell Line, Chromatin, Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly, Gene Regulatory Networks, Gene Silencing, Humans, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Receptors, Steroid, Transcriptional Activation",Transcription,,Nacht
21402082,The large-scale evolution by generating new genes from gene duplication; similarity and difference between monoploid and diploid organisms.,"On the basis of the concept of biological activity, the large-scale evolution by generating new genes from gene duplication is theoretically compared between the monoploid organism and the diploid organism. The comparison is carried out not only for the process of generating one new gene but also for the process of generating two or more kinds of new genes from successive gene duplication. This comparison reveals the following difference in evolutionary pattern between the monoploids and diploids. The monoploid organism is more suitable to generate one or two new genes step by step but its successive gene duplication is obliged to generate smaller sizes of genes by the severer lowering of biological activity or self-reproducing rate. This is consistent with the evolutionary pattern of prokaryotes having steadily developed chemical syntheses, O₂-releasing photosynthesis and O₂-respiration in the respective lineages. On the other hand, the diploid organism with the plural number of homologous chromosome pairs has a chance to get together many kinds of new genes by the hybridization of variants having experienced different origins of gene duplication. Although this strategy of hybridization avoids the severe lowering of biological activity, it takes the longer time to establish the homozygotes of the more kinds of new genes. During this long period, furthermore different types of variants are accumulated in the population, and their successive hybridization sometimes yields various styles of new organisms. This evolutionary pattern explains the explosive divergence of body plans that has occasionally occurred in the diploid organisms, because the cell differentiation is a representative character exhibited by many kinds of genes and its evolution to the higher hierarchy constructs body plans.",2011-08-31,"Animals, Diploidy, Eukaryotic Cells, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Duplication, Genes, Prokaryotic Cells",J Theor Biol,10.1016/j.jtbi.2011.03.006,Otsuka

Here we used an excess of significant markers (ESM) test to study gene-level associations in previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) SNP data from a family-based sample, having medically severe suicide attempt (SA) as main outcome in the offspring. In SA without major psychiatric disorders (N = 498), a screening of 5,316 genes across the genome suggested association 17 genes (at fdr < 0.05). Genes RETREG1 (a.k.a. FAM134B), GSN, GNAS, and CACNA1D were particularly robust to different methodological variations. Comparison with the more widely used Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) methods, mainly supported RETREG1, GSN, RNASEH2B, UBE2H, and CACNA1D by using the ""mean"" model, and ranked 13 of the same genes as ESM among its top-17. Complementing the ESM screen by using MAGMA to analyze 17,899 genes, we observed excess of genes with p < .05 by using the ""top"" model, and the ""mean"" model suggested additional genes with genome-wide fdr < 0.25. Overrepresentation analysis of 10 selected gene sets using all genes with p < .05, showed significant results for synaptic genes, genes differentially expressed in brain development and for ~12% of the SA polygenic association genes identified previously in this sample. Exploratory analysis linked some of the ESM top-17 genes to psychotropic drugs and we examined the allelic heterogeneity in the previous SA candidate GRIN2B.

If some of these genes survive across speciations, then extant organisms will contain a patchwork of genes whose ancestors first appeared at different times. Standard phylostratigraphy, the technique of partitioning genes by their age, is based solely on protein similarity algorithms.

27022972,"Selection of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Normalization in Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn under Abiotic Stresses, Hormone Treatments and Different Tissues.","Peucedanum praeruptorum Dunn is one of the main traditional Chinese medicines producing coumarins and plenty of literatures are focused on the biosynthesis of coumarins. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used method in studying the biosynthesis pathway and the selection of reference genes plays a crucial role in accurate normalization. To facilitate biosynthesis study of coumarins, twelve candidate reference genes were selected from the transcriptome database of P. praeruptorum according to previous studies. Then, BestKeeper, geNoFrm and NormFinder were used for selecting stably expressed reference genes in different tissues and under various stress treatments. The results indicated that, among the twelve candidate reference genes, the SAND family protein (SAND), actin 2 (ACT2), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 9 (UBC9), protein phosphatase 2A gene (PP2A) and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP1) were the most stable reference genes under different experimental treatments, while glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and tubulin beta-6 (TUB6) were the least stable genes. In addition, the suitability of SAND, TIP41-like protein (TIP41), UBC9, ACT2, TUB6 and their combination as reference genes were confirmed by normalizing the expression of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase (ACO) in different treatments.

They are found in many organisms from fungi to humans. The myosin gene family in Bombyx mori is poorly studied, even though the molecular functions of these genes in vertebrates and insects, such as Drosophila, are well known. We identified 16 myosin genes from B. mori and identified the myosin genes in 12 vertebrates, eight insects, three nematodes, and seven protozoa. The number of myosin genes in vertebrates is double the number in invertebrates. The number of myosin isoforms in classes I and II is larger in vertebrates compared to invertebrates. B. mori myosin genes can be classified into 11 classes. Compared to B. mori, some myosin classes are not present in other insects. Classes I, II, XVIII, and XXI appear to be important for insect survival because they are conserved among nine insects. The relatively large sizes of B. mori myosin genes are due to their longer introns. Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis demonstrated that many B. mori myosin genes have tissue-specific expression and exhibit temporal-specific activity during metamorphosis.

The ramie defense mechanism against P. coffeae infection is poorly understood, which hinders efforts to improve resistance via breeding programs. In this study, the transcriptome of the resistant ramie cultivar Qingdaye was characterized using Illumina sequence technology. About 46.3 million clean pair end (PE) reads were generated and assembled into 40,826 unigenes with a mean length of 830 bp. Digital gene expression (DGE) analysis was performed on both the control roots (CK) and P. coffeae-challenged roots (CH), and the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified.

Among them, the expressions of 117 and 20 DEGs were up- and down-regulated in P. coffeae-challenged ramie, respectively. The expression patterns of 15 candidate genes determined by qRT-PCR confirmed the results of DGE analysis. Time-course expression profiles of eight defense-related genes in susceptible and resistant ramie cultivars were different after P. coffeae inoculation.

However, the efficacy and utility of available drug therapies for melanoma are limited. The objective of the present study was to identify potential genes associated with melanoma progression and to explore approved therapeutic drugs that target these genes. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis was used to construct a gene co-expression network, explore the associations between genes and clinical characteristics and identify potential biomarkers. Gene expression profiles of the GSE65904 dataset were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. RNA-sequencing data and clinical information associated with melanoma obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas were used for biomarker validation. A total of 15 modules were identified through average linkage hierarchical clustering. In the two significant modules, three network hub genes associated with melanoma prognosis were identified: C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4), interleukin 7 receptor (IL7R) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit γ (PIK3CG). The receiver operating characteristic curve indicated that the mRNA levels of these genes exhibited excellent prognostic efficiency for primary and metastatic tumor tissues. In addition, the proximity between candidate genes associated with melanoma progression and drug targets obtained from DrugBank was calculated in the protein interaction network, and the top 15 drugs that may be suitable for treating melanoma were identified. In summary, co-expression network analysis led to the selection of CXCR4, IL7R and PIK3CG for further basic and clinical research on melanoma.

23799036,ToP: a trend-of-disease-progression procedure works well for identifying cancer genes from multi-state cohort gene expression data for human colorectal cancer.,"Significantly expressed genes extracted from microarray gene expression data have proved very useful for identifying genetic biomarkers of diseases, including cancer. However, deriving a disease related inference from a list of differentially expressed genes has proven less than straightforward. In a systems disease such as cancer, how genes interact with each other should matter just as much as the level of gene expression. Here, in a novel approach, we used the network and disease progression properties of individual genes in state-specific gene-gene interaction networks (GGINs) to select cancer genes for human colorectal cancer (CRC) and obtain a much higher hit rate of known cancer genes when compared with methods not based on network theory. We constructed GGINs by integrating gene expression microarray data from multiple states--healthy control (Nor), adenoma (Ade), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and CRC--with protein-protein interaction database and Gene Ontology. We tracked changes in the network degrees and clustering coefficients of individual genes in the GGINs as the disease state changed from one to another. From these we inferred the state sequences Nor-Ade-CRC and Nor-IBD-CRC both exhibited a trend of (disease) progression (ToP) toward CRC, and devised a ToP procedure for selecting cancer genes for CRC. Of the 141 candidates selected using ToP, ∼50% had literature support as cancer genes, compared to hit rates of 20% to 30% for standard methods using only gene expression data. Among the 16 candidate cancer genes that encoded transcription factors, 13 were known to be tumorigenic and three were novel: CDK1, SNRPF, and ILF2. We identified 13 of the 141 predicted cancer genes as candidate markers for early detection of CRC, 11 and 2 at the Ade and IBD states, respectively.",2014-01-30,"Adenoma, Biomarkers, Tumor, Cohort Studies, Colorectal Neoplasms, Disease Progression, Early Detection of Cancer, Epistasis, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Neoplasm, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, Models, Genetic, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Transcription Factors, Transcriptome",PLoS One,,Chung

26886224,A Panel of Stably Expressed Reference Genes for Real-Time qPCR Gene Expression Studies of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos).,"Determining which reference genes have the highest stability, and are therefore appropriate for normalising data, is a crucial step in the design of real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) gene expression studies. This is particularly warranted in non-model and ecologically important species for which appropriate reference genes are lacking, such as the mallard--a key reservoir of many diseases with relevance for human and livestock health. Previous studies assessing gene expression changes as a consequence of infection in mallards have nearly universally used β-actin and/or GAPDH as reference genes without confirming their suitability as normalisers. The use of reference genes at random, without regard for stability of expression across treatment groups, can result in erroneous interpretation of data. Here, eleven putative reference genes for use in gene expression studies of the mallard were evaluated, across six different tissues, using a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection model. Tissue type influenced the selection of reference genes, whereby different genes were stable in blood, spleen, lung, gastrointestinal tract and colon. β-actin and GAPDH generally displayed low stability and are therefore inappropriate reference genes in many cases. The use of different algorithms (GeNorm and NormFinder) affected stability rankings, but for both algorithms it was possible to find a combination of two stable reference genes with which to normalise qPCR data in mallards. These results highlight the importance of validating the choice of normalising reference genes before conducting gene expression studies in ducks. The fact that nearly all previous studies of the influence of pathogen infection on mallard gene expression have used a single, non-validated reference gene is problematic. The toolkit of putative reference genes provided here offers a solid foundation for future studies of gene expression in mallards and other waterfowl.",2016-08-02,"Animals, Ducks, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Association Studies, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Software",PLoS One,,Chapman
26102990,Global Gene-Expression Analysis to Identify Differentially Expressed Genes Critical for the Heat Stress Response in Brassica rapa.,"Genome-wide dissection of the heat stress response (HSR) is necessary to overcome problems in crop production caused by global warming. To identify HSR genes, we profiled gene expression in two Chinese cabbage inbred lines with different thermotolerances, Chiifu and Kenshin. Many genes exhibited >2-fold changes in expression upon exposure to 0.5- 4 h at 45°C (high temperature, HT): 5.2% (2,142 genes) in Chiifu and 3.7% (1,535 genes) in Kenshin. The most enriched GO (Gene Ontology) items included 'response to heat', 'response to reactive oxygen species (ROS)', 'response to temperature stimulus', 'response to abiotic stimulus', and 'MAPKKK cascade'. In both lines, the genes most highly induced by HT encoded small heat shock proteins (Hsps) and heat shock factor (Hsf)-like proteins such as HsfB2A (Bra029292), whereas high-molecular weight Hsps were constitutively expressed. Other upstream HSR components were also up-regulated: ROS-scavenging genes like glutathione peroxidase 2 (BrGPX2, Bra022853), protein kinases, and phosphatases. Among heat stress (HS) marker genes in Arabidopsis, only exportin 1A (XPO1A) (Bra008580, Bra006382) can be applied to B. rapa for basal thermotolerance (BT) and short-term acquired thermotolerance (SAT) gene. CYP707A3 (Bra025083, Bra021965), which is involved in the dehydration response in Arabidopsis, was associated with membrane leakage in both lines following HS. Although many transcription factors (TF) genes, including DREB2A (Bra005852), were involved in HS tolerance in both lines, Bra024224 (MYB41) and Bra021735 (a bZIP/AIR1 [Anthocyanin-Impaired-Response-1]) were specific to Kenshin. Several candidate TFs involved in thermotolerance were confirmed as HSR genes by real-time PCR, and these assignments were further supported by promoter analysis. Although some of our findings are similar to those obtained using other plant species, clear differences in Brassica rapa reveal a distinct HSR in this species. Our data could also provide a springboard for developing molecular markers of HS and for engineering HS tolerant B. rapa.

30809802,Gene therapy in rheumatoid arthritis: Strategies to select therapeutic genes.,"Significant advances have been achieved in recent years to ameliorate rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in animal models using gene therapy approaches rather than biological treatments. Although biological agents serve as antirheumatic drugs with suppressing proinflammatory cytokine activities, they are usually accompanied by systemic immune suppression resulting from continuous or high systemic dose injections of biological agents. Therefore, gene transfer approaches have opened an interesting perspective to deliver one or multiple genes in a target-specific or inducible manner for the sustained intra-articular expression of therapeutic products. Accordingly, many studies have focused on gene transferring methods in animal models by using one of the available approaches. In this study, the important strategies used to select effective genes for RA gene therapy have been outlined. Given the work done in this field, the future looks bright for gene therapy as a new method in the clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases such as RA, and by ongoing efforts in this field, we hope to achieve feasible, safe, and effective treatment methods.",2020-05-28,"Arthritis, Rheumatoid, Cytokines, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Therapy, Genetic Vectors, Humans, Viruses",J Cell Physiol,10.1002/jcp.28392,Zavvar
26051416,Reference genes for real-time qPCR in leukocytes from asthmatic patients before and after anti-asthma treatment.,"The aim of this study was to develop a set of reference genes whose expression is stable and suitable for normalization of target gene expression measured in asthma patients during anti-asthmatic treatment. Real-time qPCR was used to determine expression of 7 candidate reference genes (18S rRNA, ACTB, B2M, GAPDH, POLR2A, RPL13A and RPL32) and 7 target genes in leukocytes from asthma patients before and after treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonist. Variance of Cq values was analyzed and stability ranking was determined with geNorm. We further investigated how the different normalization strategies affected the consistency of conclusions if the specific investigated target gene is down-regulated or up-regulated after anti-asthmatic therapy. The top-ranking reference genes determined by geNorm, when samples before and after therapy were analyzed (ACTB, B2M and GAPDH) were different from those (POLR2A and B2M) when only samples before treatment were analyzed. Using only a single reference gene for normalization of 7 target gene expression compared to our strategy, there would be as low as 19% of consistency in conclusions. We suggest the use of the geometric mean of ACTB, B2M and GAPDH for normalization of qPCR data of target genes in pharmacogenomics studies in asthma patients before and after anti-asthmatic therapy, however if gene expression is measured only before anti-asthmatic treatment, we recommend the use of the geometric mean of POLR2A and B2M.

32171790,Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) synthase genes and PHA-associated gene clusters in Pseudomonas spp. and Janthinobacterium spp. isolated from Antarctica.,"The polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) producing capability of four bacterial strains isolated from Antarctica was reported in a previous study. This study analyzed the PHA synthase genes and the PHA-associated gene clusters from the two antarctic Pseudomonas isolates (UMAB-08 and UMAB-40) and the two antarctic Janthinobacterium isolates (UMAB-56 and UMAB-60) through whole-genome sequence analysis. The Pseudomonas isolates were found to carry PHA synthase genes which fall into two different PHA gene clusters, namely Class I and Class II, which are involved in the biosynthesis of short-chain-length-PHA (SCL-PHA) and medium-chain-length-PHA (MCL-PHA), respectively. On the other hand, the Janthinobacterium isolates carry a Class I and an uncharacterized putative PHA synthase genes. No other gene involved in PHA synthesis was detected in close proximity to the uncharacterized putative PHA synthase gene in the Janthinobacterium isolates, therefore it falls into a separate clade from the ordinary Class I, II, III and IV clades of PHA synthase (PhaC) phylogenetic tree. Multiple sequence alignment showed that the uncharacterized putative PHA synthase gene contains all the highly conserved amino acid residues and the proposed catalytic triad of PHA synthase. PHA biosynthesis and in vitro PhaC enzymatic assay results showed that this uncharacterized putative PHA synthase from Janthinobacterium sp. UMAB-60 is funtional. This report adds new knowledge to the PHA synthase database as we describe scarce information of PHA synthase genes and PHA-associated gene clusters from the antarctic bacterial isolates (extreme and geographically isolated environment) and comparing with those from non-antarctic PHA-producing bacteria.",,,J Biotechnol,10.1016/j.jbiotec.2020.03.006,Tan
26973683,Avirulence Genes in Cereal Powdery Mildews: The Gene-for-Gene Hypothesis 2.0.,"The gene-for-gene hypothesis states that for each gene controlling resistance in the host, there is a corresponding, specific gene controlling avirulence in the pathogen. Allelic series of the cereal mildew resistance genes Pm3 and Mla provide an excellent system for genetic and molecular analysis of resistance specificity. Despite this opportunity for molecular research, avirulence genes in mildews remain underexplored. Earlier work in barley powdery mildew (B.g. hordei) has shown that the reaction to some Mla resistance alleles is controlled by multiple genes. Similarly, several genes are involved in the specific interaction of wheat mildew (B.g. tritici) with the Pm3 allelic series. We found that two mildew genes control avirulence on Pm3f: one gene is involved in recognition by the resistance protein as demonstrated by functional studies in wheat and the heterologous host Nicotiana benthamiana. A second gene is a suppressor, and resistance is only observed in mildew genotypes combining the inactive suppressor and the recognized Avr. We propose that such suppressor/avirulence gene combinations provide the basis of specificity in mildews. Depending on the particular gene combinations in a mildew race, different genes will be genetically identified as the ""avirulence"" gene. Additionally, the observation of two LINE retrotransposon-encoded avirulence genes in B.g. hordei further suggests that the control of avirulence in mildew is more complex than a canonical gene-for-gene interaction. To fully understand the mildew-cereal interactions, more knowledge on avirulence determinants is needed and we propose ways how this can be achieved based on recent advances in the field.

Gene expression analysis permits a better understanding of the important molecular biological characteristics of this organism, such as carbon fixation and solvent adaptation. Normalization is a prerequisite for accurate gene expression analysis, but until now, no valid reference genes have been proposed for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of C. ljungdahlii DSM 13528. In this study, seven candidate reference genes (gyrA, rho, fotl, rpoA, gukl, recA, 16S rRNA) were selected for qRT-PCR quantification of their expression levels in various culture conditions that corresponded to different carbon sources and stresses. Two analytical programs, geNorm and NormFinder, were used to evaluate reference gene stability.

27536316,Assessment of Suitable Reference Genes for Quantitative Gene Expression Studies in Melon Fruits.,"Melon (Cucumis melo L.) is an attractive model plant for investigating fruit development because of its morphological, physiological, and biochemical diversity. Quantification of gene expression by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with stably expressed reference genes for normalization can effectively elucidate the biological functions of genes that regulate fruit development. However, the reference genes for data normalization in melon fruits have not yet been systematically validated. This study aims to assess the suitability of 20 genes for their potential use as reference genes in melon fruits. Expression variations of these genes were measured in 24 samples that represented different developmental stages of fertilized and parthenocarpic melon fruits by qRT-PCR analysis. GeNorm identified ribosomal protein L (CmRPL) and cytosolic ribosomal protein S15 (CmRPS15) as the best pair of reference genes, and as many as five genes including CmRPL, CmRPS15, TIP41-like family protein (CmTIP41), cyclophilin ROC7 (CmCYP7), and ADP ribosylation factor 1 (CmADP) were required for more reliable normalization. NormFinder ranked CmRPS15 as the best single reference gene, and RAN GTPase gene family (CmRAN) and TATA-box binding protein (CmTBP2) as the best combination of reference genes in melon fruits. Their effectiveness was further validated by parallel analyses on the activities of soluble acid invertase and sucrose phosphate synthase, and expression profiles of their respective encoding genes CmAIN2 and CmSPS1, as well as sucrose contents during melon fruit ripening. The validated reference genes will help to improve the accuracy of gene expression studies in melon fruits. ",2016-08-18,,Front Plant Sci,,Kong

While it had long been known that fundamental cellular processes, commonly referred to as housekeeping functions, are shared by animals and plants across the planet-processes such as the storage of information in genomic DNA, transcription, translation and the machinery for these processes, universal codon usage, and metabolic enzymes-Hox genes were different: mutations in these genes caused ""bizarre"" homeotic transformations of insect body parts that were certainly interesting but were expected to be idiosyncratic. The isolation of the genes responsible for these bizarre phenotypes turned out to be highly conserved Hox genes that play roles in embryonic patterning throughout Metazoa. How Hox genes have changed to promote the development of diverse body plans remains a central issue of the field of evo-devo today.

30485330,Evaluation of transcriptionally regulated genes identifies NCOR1 in hormone receptor negative breast tumors and lung adenocarcinomas as a potential tumor suppressor gene.,"Regulation of transcription is a key process in cellular homeostasis. It depends on regulators that either repress or stimulate the transcription of genes, therefore controlling different biological functions. The Nuclear Receptor Corepressor 1 (NCOR1) is one of those co-repressors that regulate the transcription by facilitating the recruitment of HDAC1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7. In our article, by using an in silico approach, we evaluate the mutational status of NCOR1 in breast and lung tumors. We identified that NORC1 is mutated in more than 3% of breast tumors and lung adenocarcinomas and linked this fact with detrimental outcome in some subtypes, particularly in those that are hormone receptor negative. In addition to these findings, as mutations in this gene are deleterious, we confirmed that high levels of this gene were linked with good prognosis in the same tumor subtypes. Findings in the same direction were identified in lung adenocarcinomas, with mutations associated with detrimental prognosis and high expression with better outcome. In conclusion, hereby we describe the presence and prognostic role of mutations in the NCOR1 gene in hormone receptor negative breast and lung adenocarcinomas, and we also confirm that NCOR1 is a tumor suppressor gene.

The increasing accumulation of complete genome sequences and large-scale gene expression datasets has provided a powerful resource for phylogenomic inference and unsupervised identification of genes involved in plant meiosis. By integrating sequence homology and expression data, 164, 131, 124 and 162 genes potentially important for meiosis were identified in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, Selaginella moellendorffii and Pogonatum aloides, respectively. The predicted genes were assigned to 45 meiotic GO terms, and their functions were related to different processes occurring during meiosis in various organisms. Most of the predicted meiotic genes underwent lineage-specific duplication events during plant evolution, with about 30% of the predicted genes retaining only a single copy in higher plant genomes.

Using newly developed approach, 478, 485, 1,194, 1,665, 2,042 and 374 R genes were identified from the genomes of tomato Heinz1706, wild tomato LA716, potato DM1-3, pepper Zunla-1 and wild pepper Chiltepin and tobacco TN90, respectively. The majority of R genes from Solanaceae were grouped into 87 subfamilies, including 16 TIR-NBS-LRR (TNL) and 71 non-TNL subfamilies. Each subfamily was annotated manually, including identification of intron/exon structure and intron phase. Interestingly, TNL subfamilies have similar intron phase patterns, while the non-TNL subfamilies have diverse intron phase due to frequent gain of introns. Prevalent presence/absence polymorphic R gene loci were found among Solanaceae species, and an integrated map with 427 R loci was constructed. The pepper genome (2,042 in Chiltepin) has at least four times of R genes as in tomato (478 in Heinz1706). The high number of R genes in pepper genome is due to the amplification of R genes in a few subfamilies, such as the Rpi-blb2 and BS2 subfamilies.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HCC remain unknown. To identify the candidate genes in the progression of HCC, gene expression profiles GSE14520, GSE54236, GSE57957 and GSE64041 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GEO). A total of 405 tumor and 399 para-carcinoma samples from patients with HCC were examined to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by function enrichment analyses including Gene Ontology (GO) functions and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways.

The module analysis and Hub genes validation were performed using Cytoscape software. Hierarchical clustering of hub genes was evaluated using UCSC Cancer Genomics Browser. Survival analyses of Hub genes were performed using Kaplan Meier Plotter database. Genes specifically expressed in the liver were analyzed using GENEVESTIGATOR database.

Euglena gracilis, a eukaryotic phytoflagellate, synthesizes several carotenoids: β-carotene, neoxanthin, diadinoxanthin and diatoxanthin. Temperature is one of the most striking external stimuli altering carotenoid production. In the present study, to elucidate the regulation of carotenoid synthesis of E. gracilis in response to environmental stimuli, we functionally identified phytoene desaturase genes (crtP1 and crtP2) and the ζ-carotene desaturase gene (crtQ) of this alga and analyzed expression of those genes and the composition of major carotenoids in cells grown under cold (20ï¿½C) and high-intensity light (HL; 240 ï¿½mol photon m-2 s-1) conditions. 20ï¿½C-HL treatment increased the transcriptional level of the phytoene synthase gene (crtB), and crtP1 and crtP2, whose products catalyze the early steps of carotenoid biosynthesis in this alga. Cultivation at 20ï¿½C under illumination at 55 ï¿½mol photon m-2 s-1 (low-intensity light; LL) decreased the cell concentration, Chl and total major carotenoid content by 61, 75 and 50%, respectively, relative to control (25ï¿½C-LL) cells. When grown at 20ï¿½C-HL, the cells showed a greater decrease in cell concentration and photosynthetic pigment contents than those in 20ï¿½C-LL. β-Carotene, neoxanthin and diadinoxanthin contents were decreased by more than half in 20ï¿½C-LL and 20ï¿½C-HL treatments. On the other hand, when subjected to 20ï¿½C-LL and 20ï¿½C-HL, the cells retained a diatoxanthin content comparable with control cells. Our findings suggested that diatoxanthin plays crucial roles in the acclimation to cold and intense light condition.

27734920,Bacterial intra-species gene loss occurs in a largely clocklike manner mostly within a pool of less conserved and constrained genes.,"Gene loss is a major contributor to the evolution of bacterial gene content. Gene loss may occur as a result of shifts in environment leading to changes in the intensity and/or directionality of selection applied for the maintenance of specific genes. Gene loss may also occur in a more neutral manner, when gene functions are lost that were not subject to strong selection to be maintained, irrespective of changes to environment. Here, we used a pangenome-based approach to investigate patterns of gene loss across 15 bacterial species. We demonstrate that gene loss tends to occur mostly within a pool of genes that are less constrained within species, even in those strains from which they are not lost, and less conserved across bacterial species. Our results indicate that shifts in selection, resulting from shifts in environment are not required to explain the majority of gene loss events occurring within a diverse collection of bacterial species. Caution should therefore be taken when attributing differences in gene content to differences in environment.",2018-04-13,"Bacteria, Bacterial Proteins, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Bacterial, Genome, Bacterial, Phylogeny",Sci Rep,,Bolotin
29391275,Ortholog-based screening and identification of genes related to intracellular survival.,"Bioinformatics and comparative genomics analysis methods were used to predict unknown pathogen genes based on homology with identified or functionally clustered genes. In this study, the genes of common pathogens were analyzed to screen and identify genes associated with intracellular survival through sequence similarity, phylogenetic tree analysis and the λ-Red recombination system test method. The total 38,952 protein-coding genes of common pathogens were divided into 19,775 clusters. As demonstrated through a COG analysis, information storage and processing genes might play an important role intracellular survival. Only 19 clusters were present in facultative intracellular pathogens, and not all were present in extracellular pathogens. Construction of a phylogenetic tree selected 18 of these 19 clusters. Comparisons with the DEG database and previous research revealed that seven other clusters are considered essential gene clusters and that seven other clusters are associated with intracellular survival. Moreover, this study confirmed that clusters screened by orthologs with similar function could be replaced with an approved uvrY gene and its orthologs, and the results revealed that the usg gene is associated with intracellular survival.

28076279,Identification and Validation of Reference Genes for the Normalization of Gene Expression Data in qRT-PCR Analysis in Aphis gossypii (Hemiptera: Aphididae).,"To obtain accurate and reliable results from quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, it is necessary to select suitable reference genes as standards for normalizing target gene expression data. QRT-PCR is a popular analytical methodology for studying gene expression and it has been used widely in studies of Aphis gossypii Glover in recent years. However, there is absence of study on the stability of the expression of reference genes in A. gossypii. In this study, eight commonly used candidate reference genes, including 18S, 28S, β-ACT, GAPDH, EF1α, RPL7, α-TUB, and TBP, were evaluated under various experimental conditions to assess their suitability for use in the normalization of qRT-PCR data. The optimal number of reference genes was determined using the geNorm program, and the suitability of particular reference genes was empirically validated by performing normalizations of expression data for the HSP70 gene. The results showed the most suitable combinations of reference genes for the different experimental conditions. For experiments based on divergent developmental stages, EF1α, β-ACT, and RPL7 are the optimal reference gene combination, both EF1α and β-ACT are the optimal combination used in the experiments of different geographical populations, whereas for experiments of the temperature changes, the combination of GAPDH and RPL7 is optimal, both 18S and β-ACT are an optimal combination for feeding assay experiments. These research results should be useful for the selection of the suitable reference genes to obtain reliable qRT-PCR data in the gene expression study of A. gossypii.",2017-02-07,"Animals, Aphids, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Profiling, Insect Proteins, Nymph, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",J Insect Sci,,Ma

29518107,Gene-gene interactions among coding genes of iron-homeostasis proteins and APOE-alleles in cognitive impairment diseases.,"Cognitive impairments of different aetiology share alterations in iron and lipid homeostasis with mutual relationships. Since iron and cholesterol accumulation impact on neurodegenerative disease, the associated gene variants are appealing candidate targets for risk and disease progression assessment. In this light, we explored the role of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the main iron homeostasis genes and in the main lipoprotein transporter gene (APOE) in a cohort of 765 patients with dementia of different origin: Alzheimer's disease (AD) n = 276; vascular dementia (VaD), n = 255; mild cognitive impairment (MCI), n = 234; and in normal controls (n = 1086). In details, four genes of iron homeostasis (Hemochromatosis (HFE: C282Y, H63D), Ferroportin (FPN1: -8CG), Hepcidin (HAMP: -582AG), Transferrin (TF: P570S)), and the three major alleles of APOE (APOE2, APOE3, APOE4) were analyzed to explore causative interactions and synergies. In single analysis, HFE 282Y allele yielded a 3-fold risk reduction in the whole cohort of patients (P<0.0001), confirmed in AD and VaD, reaching a 5-fold risk reduction in MCI (P = 0.0019). The other iron SNPs slightly associated with risk reduction whereas APOE4 allele resulted in increased risk, reaching more than 7-fold increased risk in AD homozygotes (P = 0.001), confirmed to a lower extent in VaD and MCI (P = 0.038 and P = 0.013 respectively) as well as in the whole group (P<0.0001). Comparisons of Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) among AD showed appreciable lowering in APOE4 carriers (P = 0.038), confirmed in the whole cohort of patients (P = 0.018). In interaction analysis, the HFE 282Y allele completely extinguished the APOE4 allele associated risk. Conversely, the coexistence in patients of a substantial number of iron SNPs accrued the APOE4 detrimental effect on MMSE. Overall, the analysis highlighted how a specific iron-allele burden, defined as different combinations of iron gene variants, might have different effects on cognitive impairment and might modulate the effects of established genetic risk factors such as APOE4. Our results suggest that established genetic risk factors might be affected by specific genetic backgrounds, making patients differently suited to manage iron accumulation adding new genetic insights in neurodegeneration. The recently recognized interconnections between iron and lipids, suggest that these pathways might share more than expected. We therefore extended to additional iron gene variants the newly proposed influencing mechanisms that HFE gene has on cholesterol metabolism. Our results have a strong translational potential promoting new pharmacogenetics studies on therapeutic target identification aimed at optimally tuning brain iron levels.",2018-07-13,"Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Alleles, Alzheimer Disease, Apolipoproteins E, Cation Transport Proteins, Cognitive Dysfunction, Dementia, Vascular, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Hemochromatosis Protein, Hepcidins, Homeostasis, Humans, Iron, Male, Mental Status and Dementia Tests, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Risk Factors, Transferrin",PLoS One,,Tisato

30451788,Integration of protein interaction and gene co-expression information for identification of melanoma candidate genes.,"Cutaneous melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that causes death worldwide. Although much has been learned about the molecular basis of melanoma genesis and progression, there is also increasing appreciation for the continuing discovery of melanoma genes to improve the genetic understanding of this malignancy. In the present study, melanoma candidate genes were identified by analysis of the common network from cancer type-specific RNA-Seq co-expression data and protein-protein interaction profiles. Then, an integrated network containing the known melanoma-related genes represented as seed genes and the putative genes represented as linker genes was generated using the subnetwork extraction algorithm. According to the network topology property of the putative genes, we selected seven key genes (CREB1, XPO1, SP3, TNFRSF1B, CD40LG, UBR1, and ZNF484) as candidate genes of melanoma. Subsequent analysis showed that six of these genes are melanoma-associated genes and one (ZNF484) is a cancer-associated gene on the basis of the existing literature. A signature comprising these seven key genes was developed and an overall survival analysis of 461 cutaneous melanoma cases was carried out. This seven-gene signature can accurately determine the risk profile for cutaneous melanoma tumors (log-rank P=3.27E-05) and be validated on an independent clinical cohort (log-rank P=0.028). The presented seven genes might serve as candidates for studying the molecular mechanisms and help improve the prognostic risk assessment, which have clinical implications for melanoma patients.",2019-06-14,"Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Humans, Male, Melanoma, Prognosis, Skin Neoplasms",Melanoma Res,10.1097/CMR.0000000000000525,Wu
31870788,Molecular characterization and RNA interference analysis of the DEAD-box gene family in Locusta migratoria.,"DEAD-box (DDX) genes encode a group of RNA helicases that are highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, and appear to participate in almost every aspect of RNA metabolism. Studies have been extensively done in yeast and human, in insect, beyond the flies, however, the information of these genes is limited. Here, we therefore identified and characterized 32 DDX genes from Locusta migratoria (L. migratoria), a crop pest. Overview of the gene structure and domain composition showed that the gene size varies significantly from one to fifteen exons, and the encoded proteins contain the conserved helicase core with various extensions at their amino and carboxyl termini. Phylogenetic trees informed that these locust DDX family members have orthologs in all insect species examined and can be classified into 30 subfamilies, all of them found counterparts in human, and most in yeast as well. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that these genes are expressed in all stages and tissues examined, overall with higher expression level at second and third-instar nymphs and in the reproductive organs. RNA interference (RNAi) analyses showed that seven genes cause lethal phenotype when silenced, of which five lead to defective midgut and gastric caecum, indicating that these genes are essential for the survival and maintenance of normal digestive organs of locust. These data provide a foundation for further functional analysis of these DDX genes in locust.",2020-01-09,"Animals, DEAD-box RNA Helicases, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Insect Proteins, Locusta migratoria, Multigene Family, Phenotype, Phylogeny, RNA Interference",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144297,Wang
31034013,"Gene duplication led to divergence of expression patterns, protein-protein interaction patterns and floral development functions of AGL6-like genes in the basal angiosperm Magnolia wufengensis (Magnoliaceae).","The MADS-box family genes play critical roles in the regulation of growth and development of flowering plants. AGAMOUS-LIKE 6 (AGL6)-like genes are one of the most enigmatic subfamilies of the MADS-box family because of highly variable expression patterns and ambiguous functions, which have long puzzled researchers. A lot of AGL6 homologs have been identified from gymnosperms and angiosperms. However, only a few have been characterized, especially for basal angiosperm taxa. Magnolia wufengensis is a woody basal angiosperm from the family Magnoliaceae. In the current study, the phylogenesis, expression and protein-protein interaction (PPI) patterns, and functions of two AGL6 homologs from M. wufengensis, MawuAGL6-1 and MawuAGL6-2, were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the two AGL6 duplicates may have arisen by gene duplication before the divergence of Magnoliaceae and Lauraceae, with the diversification of their expression and PPI patterns after gene duplication. Functional analysis revealed that, in addition to common functions in accelerating flowering, MawuAGL6-1 might be responsible for flower meristem determinacy, while MawuAGL6-2 is preferentially recruited to regulate tepal morphogenesis. These findings further advance our understanding of the evolution of phylogenesis, expression, interaction and functions of AGL6 lineage genes from basal angiosperms, as well as the entire AGL6 lineage genes, and the significance of AGL6 lineage genes in the evolution and biological diversity.",2019-12-06,"Amino Acid Sequence, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Duplication, Gene Expression, Magnolia, Period Circadian Proteins, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Sequence Alignment",Tree Physiol,10.1093/treephys/tpz010,Ma

29098594,"A Comprehensive Computational Analysis of Mycobacterium Genomes Pinpoints the Genes Co-occurring with YczE, a Membrane Protein Coding Gene Under the Putative Control of a MocR, and Predicts its Function.","Bacterial proteins belonging to the YczE family are predicted to be membrane proteins of yet unknown function. In many bacterial species, the yczE gene coding for the YczE protein is divergently transcribed with respect to an adjacent transcriptional regulator of the MocR family. According to in silico predictions, proteins named YczR are supposed to regulate the expression of yczE genes. These regulators linked to the yczE genes are predicted to constitute a subfamily within the MocR family. To put forward hypotheses amenable to experimental testing about the possible function of the YczE proteins, a phylogenetic profile strategy was applied. This strategy consists in searching for those genes that, within a set of genomes, co-occur exclusively with a certain gene of interest. Co-occurrence can be suggestive of a functional link. A set of 30 mycobacterial complete proteomes were collected. Of these, only 16 contained YczE proteins. Interestingly, in all cases each yczE gene was divergently transcribed with respect to a yczR gene. Two orthology clustering procedures were applied to find proteins co-occurring exclusively with the YczE proteins. The reported results suggest that YczE may be involved in the membrane translocation and metabolism of sulfur-containing compounds mostly in rapidly growing, low pathogenicity mycobacterial species. These observations may hint at potential targets for therapies to treat the emerging opportunistic infections provoked by the widespread environmental mycobacterial species and may contribute to the delineation of the genomic and physiological differences between the pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacterial species.",2018-08-27,"Amino Acid Sequence, Bacterial Proteins, Computational Biology, Databases, Protein, Genes, Bacterial, Membrane Proteins, Mycobacterium, Open Reading Frames, Phylogeny, Proteome",Interdiscip Sci,,Milano
24498417,Identification of nitrogen-fixing genes and gene clusters from metagenomic library of acid mine drainage.,"Biological nitrogen fixation is an essential function of acid mine drainage (AMD) microbial communities. However, most acidophiles in AMD environments are uncultured microorganisms and little is known about the diversity of nitrogen-fixing genes and structure of nif gene cluster in AMD microbial communities. In this study, we used metagenomic sequencing to isolate nif genes in the AMD microbial community from Dexing Copper Mine, China. Meanwhile, a metagenome microarray containing 7,776 large-insertion fosmids was constructed to screen novel nif gene clusters. Metagenomic analyses revealed that 742 sequences were identified as nif genes including structural subunit genes nifH, nifD, nifK and various additional genes. The AMD community is massively dominated by the genus Acidithiobacillus. However, the phylogenetic diversity of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms is much higher than previously thought in the AMD community. Furthermore, a 32.5-kb genomic sequence harboring nif, fix and associated genes was screened by metagenome microarray. Comparative genome analysis indicated that most nif genes in this cluster are most similar to those of Herbaspirillum seropedicae, but the organization of the nif gene cluster had significant differences from H. seropedicae. Sequence analysis and reverse transcription PCR also suggested that distinct transcription units of nif genes exist in this gene cluster. nifQ gene falls into the same transcription unit with fixABCX genes, which have not been reported in other diazotrophs before. All of these results indicated that more novel diazotrophs survive in the AMD community.

The quantitative real time PCR (RT-qPCR) has appeared as a sensitive and powerful technique to measure gene expression in living organisms during different development stages. In this study, we evaluated ten candidate genes, including 25S ribosomal RNA gene (25S rRNA), actin1 gene (ACT1), carotenoid-binding protein 20 gene (CBP20), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (GAPDH), Ubiquitin gene (UBQ), eukaryotic elongation factor 1-αgene (eEF-1α), α-tubulin gene (α-TUB), β-tubulin gene (β-TUB), eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4α-1 gene (eIF-4α) and NAC domain protein gene(NAC) in a series of 30 M. lutarioriparia samples followed by statistical algorithms geNorm and Normfinder to analyze the gene expression stability. The results indicated that eIF-4αand UBQ were the most stable expressed genes while CBP20 showed as the least stable among all the samples.

The present study is mainly focused on an opportunistic, nosocomial bacterial strain Enterococcus faecalis V583, which possess acquired exogenous AMR genes portraying resistance against Chloramphenicol, Tetracycline, Vancomycin, Linezolid, Ampicillin and other antibiotics. An interaction network of eight AMR genes along with 40 functional partners have been constructed and analysed. Functional enrichment analysis highlighted 20, 21 and 22 genes having significant roles in Cellular Component (CC), Molecular Functions (MF) and Biological Process (BP) respectively.

The results of conserved motif analysis showed that these SOS homologs contained similar protein structures. By analyzing the cis-elements in the promoters of those BjSOS genes, several hormone- and stress-related cis-elements were found.

25723393,Selection of reference genes for qPCR- and ddPCR-based analyses of gene expression in Senescing Barley leaves.,"Leaf senescence is a tightly regulated developmental or stress-induced process. It is accompanied by dramatic changes in cell metabolism and structure, eventually leading to the disintegration of chloroplasts, the breakdown of leaf proteins, internucleosomal fragmentation of nuclear DNA and ultimately cell death. In light of the global and intense reorganization of the senescing leaf transcriptome, measuring time-course gene expression patterns in this model is challenging due to the evident problems associated with selecting stable reference genes. We have used oligonucleotide microarray data to identify 181 genes with stable expression in the course of dark-induced senescence of barley leaf. From those genes, we selected 5 candidates and confirmed their invariant expression by both reverse transcription quantitative PCR and droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). We used the selected reference genes to normalize the level of the expression of the following senescence-responsive genes in ddPCR assays: SAG12, ICL, AGXT, CS and RbcS. We were thereby able to achieve a substantial reduction in the data variability. Although the use of reference genes is not considered mandatory in ddPCR assays, our results show that it is advisable in special cases, specifically those that involve the following conditions: i) a low number of repeats, ii) the detection of low-fold changes in gene expression or iii) series data comparisons (such as time-course experiments) in which large sample variation greatly affects the overall gene expression profile and biological interpretation of the data.

24510763,Characterization of Rubisco activase genes in maize: an α-isoform gene functions alongside a β-isoform gene.,"Rubisco activase (RCA) catalyzes the activation of Rubisco in vivo and plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth. In maize (Zea mays), only β-form RCA genes have been cloned and characterized. In this study, a genome-wide survey revealed the presence of an α-form RCA gene and a β-form RCA gene in the maize genome, herein referred to as ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ, respectively. An analysis of genomic DNA and complementary DNA sequences suggested that alternative splicing of the ZmRCAβ precursor mRNA (premRNA) at its 3' untranslated region could produce two distinctive ZmRCAβ transcripts. Analyses by electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-tandem time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed that ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ encode larger and smaller polypeptides of approximately 46 and 43 kD, respectively. Transcriptional analyses demonstrated that the expression levels of both ZmRCAα and ZmRCAβ were higher in leaves and during grain filling and that expression followed a specific cyclic day/night pattern. In 123 maize inbred lines with extensive genetic diversity, the transcript abundance and protein expression levels of these two RCA genes were positively correlated with grain yield. Additionally, both genes demonstrated a similar correlation with grain yield compared with three C₄ photosynthesis genes. Our data suggest that, in addition to the β-form RCA-encoding gene, the α-form RCA-encoding gene also contributes to the synthesis of RCA in maize and support the hypothesis that RCA genes may play an important role in determining maize productivity.",2014-12-03,"Amino Acid Sequence, Cloning, Molecular, DNA, Complementary, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Plant, Isoenzymes, Molecular Sequence Data, Peptides, Plant Leaves, Plant Proteins, RNA, Messenger, Seeds, Sequence Alignment, Zea mays",Plant Physiol,,Yin

29130383,Identification of a novel gene in ROD9 island of Salmonella Enteritidis involved in the alteration of virulence-associated genes expression.,"Salmonella enterica subsp. I serovar Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis), one of the causative agents for non-typhoidal gastrointestinal diseases in humans is an intracellular bacterium and mechanism for its invasion into host cells is critical to cause infection. The virulence of the pathogen is explained by the expression of genes located on its pathogenicity islands, mostly encoded under SPI-1 and SPI-2. However, S. Typhimurium SL1344, despite sharing ∼98% of its genome with S. Enteritidis P125109, lacks few regions of differences (ROD) that are hypothesized to impart virulence potential to S. Enteritidis. In this study, we created different mutants in the ROD9 island of S. Enteritidis, also referred as SPI-19 and identified a novel locus, SEN1005, encoding a hypothetical protein that is involved in its pathogenesis. ΔSEN1005 displayed significantly reduced entry into cultured epithelial cells as well as uptake by macrophages and failed to cause acute colitis in C57BL/6 mice at day 3 post-infection (p.i.). Additionally, the global transcriptome analysis revealed a highly repressed SPI-1 and other down-regulated genes responsible for flagellar assembly, chemotaxis and motility in the mutant which correlated with decreased invasion and abated inflammation as compared to the wild-type. Therefore, our findings revealed that ΔSEN1005 was attenuated in vitro as well as in vivo and we propose this hypothetical protein to play a role in altering the expression of genes involved in Salmonella virulence.",2018-09-17,"Animals, Cells, Cultured, Disease Models, Animal, Epithelial Cells, Gene Deletion, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genes, Bacterial, Genes, Regulator, Genetic Loci, Genomic Islands, Humans, Macrophages, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Mutagenesis, Salmonella Infections, Salmonella enteritidis, Virulence Factors",Virulence,,Das

23396833,Prevalent role of gene features in determining evolutionary fates of whole-genome duplication duplicated genes in flowering plants.,"The evolution of genes and genomes after polyploidization has been the subject of extensive studies in evolutionary biology and plant sciences. While a significant number of duplicated genes are rapidly removed during a process called fractionation, which operates after the whole-genome duplication (WGD), another considerable number of genes are retained preferentially, leading to the phenomenon of biased gene retention. However, the evolutionary mechanisms underlying gene retention after WGD remain largely unknown. Through genome-wide analyses of sequence and functional data, we comprehensively investigated the relationships between gene features and the retention probability of duplicated genes after WGDs in six plant genomes, Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), poplar (Populus trichocarpa), soybean (Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays). The results showed that multiple gene features were correlated with the probability of gene retention. Using a logistic regression model based on principal component analysis, we resolved evolutionary rate, structural complexity, and GC3 content as the three major contributors to gene retention. Cluster analysis of these features further classified retained genes into three distinct groups in terms of gene features and evolutionary behaviors. Type I genes are more prone to be selected by dosage balance; type II genes are possibly subject to subfunctionalization; and type III genes may serve as potential targets for neofunctionalization. This study highlights that gene features are able to act jointly as primary forces when determining the retention and evolution of WGD-derived duplicated genes in flowering plants. These findings thus may help to provide a resolution to the debate on different evolutionary models of gene fates after WGDs.",2013-11-04,"Evolution, Molecular, Flowers, Gene Duplication, Genes, Duplicate, Genes, Plant, Logistic Models, Magnoliopsida, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Principal Component Analysis, Segmental Duplications, Genomic, Selection, Genetic, Synteny",Plant Physiol,,Jiang
31115714,A Novel Method for Identifying the Potential Cancer Driver Genes Based on Molecular Data Integration.,"The identification of the cancer driver genes is essential for personalized therapy. The mutation frequency of most driver genes is in the middle (2-20%) or even lower range, which makes it difficult to find the driver genes with low-frequency mutations. Other forms of genomic aberrations, such as copy number variations (CNVs) and epigenetic changes, may also reflect cancer progression. In this work, a method for identifying the potential cancer driver genes (iPDG) based on molecular data integration is proposed. DNA copy number variation, somatic mutation, and gene expression data of matched cancer samples are integrated. In combination with the method of iKEEG, the ""key genes"" of cancer are identified, and the change in their expression levels is used for auxiliary evaluation of whether the mutated genes are potential drivers. For a mutated gene, the concept of mutational effect is defined, which takes into account the effects of copy number variation, mutation gene itself, and its neighbor genes. The method mainly includes two steps: the first step is data preprocessing. First, DNA copy number variation and somatic mutation data are integrated. Then, the integrated data are mapped to a given interaction network, and the diffusion kernel is used to form the mutation effect matrix. The second step is to obtain the key genes by using the iKGGE method, and construct the connection matrix by means of the gene expression data of the key genes and mutation impact matrix of the mutated genes. Experiments on TCGA breast cancer and Glioblastoma multiforme datasets demonstrate that iPDG is effective not only to identify the known cancer driver genes but also to discover the rare potential driver genes. When measured by functional enrichment analysis, we find that these genes are clearly associated with these two types of cancers.",2020-02-28,"Breast Neoplasms, DNA Copy Number Variations, Datasets as Topic, Female, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genomics, Glioblastoma, Humans, Oncogenes",Biochem Genet,,Zhang

For understanding pluripotency and lineage differentiation mechanisms, a critical first step involves systematically cataloging essential genes (EGs) that are indispensable for hPSC fitness, defined as cell reproduction in this study. To map essential genetic determinants of hPSC fitness, we performed genome-scale loss-of-function screens in an inducible Cas9 H1 hPSC line cultured on feeder cells and laminin to identify EGs. Among these, we found FOXH1 and VENTX, genes that encode transcription factors previously implicated in stem cell biology, as well as an uncharacterized gene, C22orf43/DRICH1. hPSC EGs are substantially different from other human model cell lines, and EGs in hPSCs are highly context dependent with respect to different growth substrates. Our CRISPR screens establish parameters for genome-wide screens in hPSCs, which will facilitate the characterization of unappreciated genetic regulators of hPSC biology.",2020-06-22,"Cell Differentiation, Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Essential, Humans, Pluripotent Stem Cells",Cell Rep,10.1016/j.celrep.2019.02.041,Mair
23508400,Validation of reference genes for gene expression analysis in Valsa mali var. mali using real-time quantitative PCR.,"Valsa mali var. mali (Vmm), is the predominant species of apple valsa canker in China. Modern analysis of genes involved in virulence or pathogenicity usually implicate gene expression analysis most often performed using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). However, for relative gene expression analysis pertinent reference genes have to be validated before using them as internal reference. This has not been reported for Vmm, so far. Therefore, eight commonly used housekeeping genes (ACT, CYP, EF1-α, G6PDH, GAPDH, L13, TUB, and UBQ) were cloned and evaluated for their expression stability by geNorm and NormFinder. Overall, all of the candidate reference genes were found to be suitable for gene expression analysis. After analysis of 10 samples from different strains and abiotic stress treatments, G6PDH appeared to be the most suitable reference gene, whereas GAPDH was the least suitable. Moreover, taking G6PDH combined with L13 or CYP as reference genes, improved the reliability of RT-qPCR significantly. The influence of the reference system on expression data was demonstrated by analyzing Vmmpg-1 encoding an endo-polygalacturonase gene. Pectinases are considered key pathogenicity factors for this fungus. In order to better understand the role of pectinases in pathogenicity of Vmm, RT-qPCR was used for expression analysis. Our results may provide a guideline for future studies on gene expression of V. mali var. mali by using RT-qPCR.

28575649,Genetic-Variation-Driven Gene-Expression Changes Highlight Genes with Important Functions for Kidney Disease.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a complex gene-environmental disease affecting close to 10% of the US population. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified sequence variants, localized to non-coding genomic regions, associated with kidney function. Despite these robust observations, the mechanism by which variants lead to CKD remains a critical unanswered question. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis is a method to identify genetic variation associated with gene expression changes in specific tissue types. We hypothesized that an integrative analysis combining CKD GWAS and kidney eQTL results can identify candidate genes for CKD. We performed eQTL analysis by correlating genotype with RNA-seq-based gene expression levels in 96 human kidney samples. Applying stringent statistical criteria, we detected 1,886 genes whose expression differs with the sequence variants. Using direct overlap and Bayesian methods, we identified new potential target genes for CKD. With respect to one of the target genes, lysosomal beta A mannosidase (MANBA), we observed that genetic variants associated with MANBA expression in the kidney showed statistically significant colocalization with variants identified in CKD GWASs, indicating that MANBA is a potential target gene for CKD. The expression of MANBA was significantly lower in kidneys of subjects with risk alleles. Suppressing manba expression in zebrafish resulted in renal tubule defects and pericardial edema, phenotypes typically induced by kidney dysfunction. Our analysis shows that gene-expression changes driven by genetic variation in the kidney can highlight potential new target genes for CKD development.",2017-07-31,"Animals, Base Sequence, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Knockdown Techniques, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genetic Variation, Genome-Wide Association Study, Humans, Kidney, Kidney Diseases, Linkage Disequilibrium, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Quantitative Trait Loci, Quantitative Trait, Heritable, Reproducibility of Results, Zebrafish, beta-Mannosidase",Am J Hum Genet,,Ko
32126384,Identification of key genes associated with spermatogenesis arrest in fox hybrids using weighted gene co-expression network analysis.,"The silver fox and the blue fox represent different genera, but produce viable offspring. Although these hybrids show obvious heterosis, they are completely sterile due to spermatogenic arrest at the early stages of spermatogenesis, especially mitosis and meiosis I; the hybrids produce few spermatogonia and primary spermatocytes, and no secondary spermatocytes. Although the mechanisms of spermatogenic arrest have been well investigated, transcriptomic differences between hybrid and the pure-species testes have not clarified. In the present study, we used RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) to generate testicular transcriptomic profiles for silver foxes, blue foxes, and reciprocal hybrids during the pre-breeding period and the breeding season. In total, 1,344,022 transcripts (≥200 bp) were generated; 1,057,724 genes were obtained; and 33,423 genes were shown to have fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) > 0.3. To identify the hub genes associated with spermatogenesis arrest, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used. Nine modules were explored. Genes in only a single module were consistently downregulated in the hybrids as compared to the pure species; these genes were significantly associated with fox hybrid male infertility. Six of the genes in this module (CATSPERD, DMRTC2, RNF17, NME5, SPEF2, SPINK2) also play key roles in mitosis and meiosis during spermatogenesis. Therefore, these six genes might be associated with fox hybrid male infertility.",,,Theriogenology,10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.02.029,Yang

Here, one hundred forty-nine homeobox genes were identified from the Asian scorpion, Mesobuthus martensii (Chelicerata: Arachnida: Scorpiones: Buthidae) based on our newly assembled genome sequence with approximately 248 × coverage. The identified homeobox genes were categorized into eight classes including 82 families: 67 ANTP class genes, 33 PRD genes, 11 LIM genes, five POU genes, six SINE genes, 14 TALE genes, five CUT genes, two ZF genes and six unclassified genes. Transcriptome data confirmed that more than half of the genes were expressed in adults. The homeobox gene diversity of the eight classes is similar to the previously analyzed Mandibulata arthropods. Interestingly, it is hypothesized that the scorpion M. martensii may have two Hox clusters. The first complete genome-wide analysis of homeobox genes in Chelicerata not only reveals the repertoire of scorpion, arachnid and chelicerate homeobox genes, but also shows some insights into the evolution of arthropod homeobox genes.

24659815,High fitness costs and instability of gene duplications reduce rates of evolution of new genes by duplication-divergence mechanisms.,"An important mechanism for generation of new genes is by duplication-divergence of existing genes. Duplication-divergence includes several different submodels, such as subfunctionalization where after accumulation of neutral mutations the original function is distributed between two partially functional and complementary genes, and neofunctionalization where a new function evolves in one of the duplicated copies while the old function is maintained in another copy. The likelihood of these mechanisms depends on the longevity of the duplicated state, which in turn depends on the fitness cost and genetic stability of the duplications. Here, we determined the fitness cost and stability of defined gene duplications/amplifications on a low copy number plasmid. Our experimental results show that the costs of carrying extra gene copies are substantial and that each additional kilo base pairs of DNA reduces fitness by approximately 0.15%. Furthermore, gene amplifications are highly unstable and rapidly segregate to lower copy numbers in absence of selection. Mathematical modeling shows that the fitness costs and instability strongly reduces the likelihood of both sub- and neofunctionalization, but that these effects can be offset by positive selection for novel beneficial functions.

24243796,Global gene expression and focused knockout analysis reveals genes associated with fungal fruiting body development in Neurospora crassa.,"Fungi can serve as highly tractable models for understanding genetic basis of sexual development in multicellular organisms. Applying a reverse-genetic approach to advance such a model, we used random and multitargeted primers to assay gene expression across perithecial development in Neurospora crassa. We found that functionally unclassified proteins accounted for most upregulated genes, whereas downregulated genes were enriched for diverse functions. Moreover, genes associated with developmental traits exhibited stage-specific peaks of expression. Expression increased significantly across sexual development for mating type gene mat a-1 and for mat A-1 specific pheromone precursor ccg-4. In addition, expression of a gene encoding a protein similar to zinc finger, stc1, was highly upregulated early in perithecial development, and a strain with a knockout of this gene exhibited arrest at the same developmental stage. A similar expression pattern was observed for genes in RNA silencing and signaling pathways, and strains with knockouts of these genes were also arrested at stages of perithecial development that paralleled their peak in expression. The observed stage specificity allowed us to correlate expression upregulation and developmental progression and to identify regulators of sexual development. Bayesian networks inferred from our expression data revealed previously known and new putative interactions between RNA silencing genes and pathways. Overall, our analysis provides a fine-scale transcriptomic landscape and novel inferences regarding the control of the multistage development process of sexual crossing and fruiting body development in N. crassa.

30897847,A Novel Insight into Functional Divergence of the MST Gene Family in Rice Based on Comprehensive Expression Patterns.,"Sugars are critical for plant growth and development as suppliers of carbon and energy, as signal molecules, or as solute molecules for osmotic homeostasis. Monosaccharide transporter (MST) genes are involved in various processes of plant growth and development as well as in response to abiotic stresses. However, the evolution and their roles of MST genes in growth and development and in coping with abiotic stresses in rice are poorly known. Here, we identified 64 MST genes in rice genome, which are classified into seven subfamilies: STP, PLT, AZT, ERD, pGlcT, INT, and XTPH. MST genes are not evenly distributed between chromosomes (Chrs) with a bias to Chr 3, 4, 7, and 11, which could be a result of duplication of fragments harboring MST genes. In total, 12 duplication events were found in the rice MST family, among which, two pairs were derived from fragmental duplications and ten pairs were from tandem duplications. The synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of duplicate gene pairs demonstrated that the MST family was under a strong negative selection during the evolution process. Furthermore, a comprehensive expression analysis conducted in 11 different tissues, three abiotic stresses, five hormone treatments, and three sugar treatments revealed different expression patterns of MST genes and indicated diversified functions of them. Our results suggest that MST genes play important roles not only in various abiotic stresses but also in hormone and sugar responses. The present results will provide a vital insight into the functional divergence of the MST family in the future study.",2020-01-09,"Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Plant, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Monosaccharide Transport Proteins, Multigene Family, Occupational Stress, Oryza, Plant Proteins, Tissue Distribution",Genes (Basel),,Deng

27515999,PoplarGene: poplar gene network and resource for mining functional information for genes from woody plants.,"Poplar is not only an important resource for the production of paper, timber and other wood-based products, but it has also emerged as an ideal model system for studying woody plants. To better understand the biological processes underlying various traits in poplar, e.g., wood development, a comprehensive functional gene interaction network is highly needed. Here, we constructed a genome-wide functional gene network for poplar (covering ~70% of the 41,335 poplar genes) and created the network web service PoplarGene, offering comprehensive functional interactions and extensive poplar gene functional annotations. PoplarGene incorporates two network-based gene prioritization algorithms, neighborhood-based prioritization and context-based prioritization, which can be used to perform gene prioritization in a complementary manner. Furthermore, the co-functional information in PoplarGene can be applied to other woody plant proteomes with high efficiency via orthology transfer. In addition to poplar gene sequences, the webserver also accepts Arabidopsis reference gene as input to guide the search for novel candidate functional genes in PoplarGene. We believe that PoplarGene (http://bioinformatics.caf.ac.cn/PoplarGene and http://124.127.201.25/PoplarGene) will greatly benefit the research community, facilitating studies of poplar and other woody plants.",2018-05-01,"Algorithms, Computational Biology, Data Mining, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Plant, Internet, Populus",Sci Rep,,Liu
24637144,Computational gene network study on antibiotic resistance genes of Acinetobacter baumannii.,"Multi Drug Resistance (MDR) in Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the major threats for emerging nosocomial infections in hospital environment. Multidrug-resistance in A. baumannii may be due to the implementation of multi-combination resistance mechanisms such as β-lactamase synthesis, Penicillin-Binding Proteins (PBPs) changes, alteration in porin proteins and in efflux pumps against various existing classes of antibiotics. Multiple antibiotic resistance genes are involved in MDR. These resistance genes are transferred through plasmids, which are responsible for the dissemination of antibiotic resistance among Acinetobacter spp. In addition, these resistance genes may also have a tendency to interact with each other or with their gene products. Therefore, it becomes necessary to understand the impact of these interactions in antibiotic resistance mechanism. Hence, our study focuses on protein and gene network analysis on various resistance genes, to elucidate the role of the interacting proteins and to study their functional contribution towards antibiotic resistance. From the search tool for the retrieval of interacting gene/protein (STRING), a total of 168 functional partners for 15 resistance genes were extracted based on the confidence scoring system. The network study was then followed up with functional clustering of associated partners using molecular complex detection (MCODE). Later, we selected eight efficient clusters based on score. Interestingly, the associated protein we identified from the network possessed greater functional similarity with known resistance genes. This network-based approach on resistance genes of A. baumannii could help in identifying new genes/proteins and provide clues on their association in antibiotic resistance.

Such screens are normally conducted in arrayed or pooled formats. There has been considerable interest in recent years to find new technological methods for conducting these gene-editing assays. We report here the first digital microfluidic method that can automate arrayed gene-editing in mammalian cells. Specifically, this method was useful in culturing lung cancer cells for up to six days, as well as implementing automated gene transfection and knockout procedures. In addition, a standardized imaging pipeline to analyse fluorescently labelled cells was also designed and implemented during these procedures. A gene editing assay for interrogating the MAPK/ERK pathway was performed to show the utility of our platform and to determine the effects of knocking out the RAF1 gene in lung cancer cells. In addition to gene knockout, we also treated the cells with an inhibitor, Sorafenib Tosylate, to determine the effects of enzymatic inhibition. The combination of enzymatic inhibition and guide targeting on device resulted in lower drug concentrations for achieving half-inhibitory effects (IC50) compared to cells treated only with the inhibitor, confirming that lung cancer cells are being successfully edited on the device. We propose that this system will be useful for other types of gene-editing assays and applications related to personalized medicine.",2018-12-11,"Automation, Cell Line, Tumor, Gene Editing, Gene Knockout Techniques, Genes, Neoplasm, Humans, Lab-On-A-Chip Devices, MAP Kinase Signaling System, Transfection",Lab Chip,10.1039/c8lc00470f,Sinha

31794148,Identification of Susceptibility Genes to Allergic Rhinitis by Gene Expression Data Sets.,"As an extremely prevalent disease worldwide, allergic rhinitis (AR) is a condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the nasal mucosa. To identify the finer molecular mechanisms associated with the AR susceptibility genes, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AR were investigated. The DEG expression and clinical data of the GSE19187 data set were used for weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). After the modules related to AR had been screened, the genes in the module were extracted for Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis, whereby the genes enriched in the KEGG pathway were regarded as the pathway-genes. The DEGs in patients with AR were subsequently screened out from GSE19187, and the sensitive genes were identified in GSE18574 in connection with the allergen challenge. Two kinds of genes were compared with the pathway-genes in order to screen the AR susceptibility genes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted to evaluate the capability of the susceptibility genes to distinguish the AR state. Based on the WGCNA in the GSE19187 data set, 10 co-expression network modules were identified. The correlation analyses revealed that the yellow module was positively correlated with the disease state of AR. A total of 89 genes were found to be involved in the enrichment of the yellow module pathway. Four genes (CST1, SH2D1B, DPP4, and SLC5A5) were upregulated in AR and sensitive to allergen challenge, whose potentials were further confirmed by ROC curve. Taken together, CST1, SH2D1B, DPP4, and SLC5A5 are susceptibility genes to AR.",,,Clin Transl Sci,,Xue
30943440,Expression profile of several genes on ecdysteroidogenic pathway related to diapause in pupal stage of Bombyx mori bivoltine strain.,"Ecdysone is involved in regulation of embryonic diapause in the silkworm, Bombyx mori. However, its mechanism still remains unclear. To explore the role of ecdysteroidogenic pathway (EP) genes in diapause process of bivoltine B. mori, the eggs of ""Qiufeng"", a bivoltine strain, were used as the study materials and arranged into diapause eggs producers (DEPs) and non-diapause eggs producers (NDEPs), respectively. The differential expression of EP genes between two groups was analysed during the early pupal stage. The expression of Shadow was significantly increased in the NDEPs in day-3 pupae and reached the peak simultaneously, indicating that Shadow was in coincidence with diapause process. To validate this hypothesis, a repression of Shadow by RNA interference was performed in day-2 pupae of NDEPs. The expression of Shadow was downregulated by RNAi, and βFtz-F1, a downstream gene of EP, was also decreased. Furthermore, the genes encoding the kynurenine-synthetase were upregulated in the ovary, and Brown, AdenoK which link Shadow to the kynurenine-synthase gene were also upregulated in the fat body. The progeny eggs appeared a light purple colour at 48 h after oviposition, revealing a certain tendency to diapause. We speculate that inhibition of Shadow upregulates 3-hydroxy-kynurenine synthesis by increasing the expression of Brown and AdenoK. In addition, Shadow was cloned, and expressed in E. coli for further functional study of Shadow protein.

27060167,WRKY domain-encoding genes of a crop legume chickpea (Cicer arietinum): comparative analysis with Medicago truncatula WRKY family and characterization of group-III gene(s).,"The WRKY genes have been identified as important transcriptional modulators predominantly during the environmental stresses, but they also play critical role at various stages of plant life cycle. We report the identification of WRKY domain (WD)-encoding genes from galegoid clade legumes chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula). In total, 78 and 98 WD-encoding genes were found in chickpea and barrel medic, respectively. Comparative analysis suggests the presence of both conserved and unique WRKYs, and expansion of WRKY family in M. truncatula primarily by tandem duplication. Exclusively found in galegoid legumes, CaWRKY16 and its orthologues encode for a novel protein having a transmembrane and partial Exo70 domains flanking a group-III WD. Genomic region of galegoids, having CaWRKY16, is more dynamic when compared with millettioids. In onion cells, fused CaWRKY16-EYFP showed punctate fluorescent signals in cytoplasm. The chickpea WRKY group-III genes were further characterized for their transcript level modulation during pathogenic stress and treatments of abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and salicylic acid (SA) by real-time PCR. Differential regulation of genes was observed during Ascochyta rabiei infection and SA treatment. Characterization of A. rabiei and SA inducible gene CaWRKY50 showed that it localizes to plant nucleus, binds to W-box, and have a C-terminal transactivation domain. Overexpression of CaWRKY50 in tobacco plants resulted in early flowering and senescence. The in-depth comparative account presented here for two legume WRKY genes will be of great utility in hastening functional characterization of crop legume WRKYs and will also help in characterization of Exo70Js.

31989707,Reduction of erythromycin resistance gene erm(F) and class 1 integron-integrase genes in wastewater by Bardenpho treatment.,"Wastewaters routinely contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and genes (ARG) that are removed to a varying degree during wastewater treatment. This study investigated the removal of the erythromycin ribosome methylase class F (erm(F)) and class 1 integron-integrase (intI1) genes at each stage from two water resource recovery facilities in southern Arizona. Although genes were significantly reduced by Bardenpho treatment, erm(F) and intI1 were still observed in ≥ 9 and 7 out of 12 secondary effluent samples. Primary processes via sedimentation or dissolved air flotation, as well as chlorine disinfection, did not significantly impact erm(F) and intI1 concentrations. Therefore, Bardenpho treatment was critical to reduce erm(F) and intI1. Concentrations of erm(F) and intI1 were compared with each other and other markers for anthropogenic pollution. Results from this study support intI1 as one suitable marker to measure erythromycin resistance genes in wastewater, as intI1 was found at higher concentrations, persisted more throughout treatment, and correlated with erm(F) at nearly every treatment stage. PRACTITIONER POINTS: Bardenpho treatment was the key process responsible for the reduction of intI1 and erm(F) genes during wastewater treatment. Primary treatment and chlorine disinfection did not impact erm(F) and intI1 gene concentrations. The intI1 gene is a suitable marker for measuring erm(F) genes in wastewater.",,,Water Environ Res,10.1002/wer.1299,Schmitz

Despite the industrial importance of genus Thymus, not any validated reference gene has not been reported for T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which could limit such investigations. In this study, the expression stability of seven housekeeping genes including Actin, Cyclophilin-18, elongation factor-1A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, 18S ribosomal RNA, Cullin, and Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein were evaluated in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris which grown at four levels of drought stress using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper algorithms. Histone deacetylase-6 (HDA-6) gene was also used for validation of evaluated reference genes. In T. vulgaris, all of the algorithms similarly ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes. In T. kotschyanus, only NormFinder and BestKeeper had a similar ranking and identified Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the two most stably expressed genes, but geNorm algorithm ranked elongation factor-1A and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as the best two reference genes. On the other hand, all algorithms ranked 18S rRNA and Cyclophilin-18 as the least stable genes in T. kotschyanus and T. vulgaris, respectively.

The ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel (RAS EP) assessed published and other publicly available evidence supporting the association of 19 genes with RASopathy conditions. Using the semiquantitative literature curation method developed by the ClinGen Gene Curation Working Group, evidence for each gene was curated and scored for Noonan syndrome (NS), Costello syndrome, cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome, NS with multiple lentigines, and Noonan-like syndrome with loose anagen hair. The curated evidence supporting each gene-disease relationship was then discussed and approved by the ClinGen RASopathy Expert Panel. Each association's strength was classified as definitive, strong, moderate, limited, disputed, or no evidence. Eleven genes were classified as definitively associated with at least one RASopathy condition. Two genes classified as strong for association with at least one RASopathy condition while one gene was moderate and three were limited. The RAS EP also disputed the association of two genes for all RASopathy conditions.

32082281,FeGenie: A Comprehensive Tool for the Identification of Iron Genes and Iron Gene Neighborhoods in Genome and Metagenome Assemblies.,"Iron is a micronutrient for nearly all life on Earth. It can be used as an electron donor and electron acceptor by iron-oxidizing and iron-reducing microorganisms and is used in a variety of biological processes, including photosynthesis and respiration. While it is the fourth most abundant metal in the Earth's crust, iron is often limiting for growth in oxic environments because it is readily oxidized and precipitated. Much of our understanding of how microorganisms compete for and utilize iron is based on laboratory experiments. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing and surge in publicly available sequence data has made it possible to probe the structure and function of microbial communities in the environment. To bridge the gap between our understanding of iron acquisition, iron redox cycling, iron storage, and magnetosome formation in model microorganisms and the plethora of sequence data available from environmental studies, we have created a comprehensive database of hidden Markov models (HMMs) based on genes related to iron acquisition, storage, and reduction/oxidation in ",,,Front Microbiol,,Garber
29571901,Disease genes prediction by HMM based PU-learning using gene expression profiles.,"Predicting disease candidate genes from human genome is a crucial part of nowadays biomedical research. According to observations, diseases with the same phenotype have the similar biological characteristics and genes associated with these same diseases tend to share common functional properties. Therefore, by applying machine learning methods, new disease genes are predicted based on previous ones. In recent studies, some semi-supervised learning methods, called Positive-Unlabeled Learning (PU-Learning) are used for predicting disease candidate genes.

31634801,Ammonia stress reduces antibiotic efflux but enriches horizontal gene transfer of antibiotic resistance genes in anaerobic digestion.,"The dynamics of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) response to ammonia stress were evaluated using metagenomics and quantitative PCR (qPCR) in anaerobic digestion (AD). Ammonia stress reduced ARGs associated with antibiotic efflux, especially the major facilitator superfamily (MFS) of tet(L), due to free ammonia (FA) that changed the proton gradient of efflux system. Nonetheless, ARGs of antibiotic target alteration, especially ermB, were enriched under ammonia stress, which could be attributed to the initiation of the internal enhancer of the transferability of the broad host range plasmid, pAMbeta1. Statistical analysis elucidated the significant changes of ARGs are directly attributed to the mobile genetic elements (MGEs), but the little affected ARGs are mainly determined by the functional microbes reflected by nitrogen cycling genes (NCyc). This study deciphered the profiles of ARGs response to ammonia stress in AD, which indicated the importance of alleviation of ammonia inhibition for the mitigation of ARGs dissemination.",2019-11-19,"Ammonia, Anaerobiosis, Anti-Bacterial Agents, Drug Resistance, Microbial, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genes, Bacterial",Bioresour Technol,10.1016/j.biortech.2019.122191,Zhang

26821659,Selection of relatively exact reference genes for gene expression studies in flixweed (Descurainia sophia) by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.,"The reliable gene expression analysis of a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) mainly depends on selecting suitable reference genes that can express stably under different experimental conditions. Thus far, no reference genes have been identified in flixweed. In this paper, 7 supposed reference genes were selected to evaluate their expression stabilities by qRT-PCR in flixweed under three conditions including different sampling times after tribenuron treatment, different organs, and different growth stages using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper statistical algorithms. The results showed that ACT7, UBC and 18SrRNA were the stable reference genes in all of the tested samples. ACT7 and UBC showed high stability in different sampling times after the tribenuron treatment. UBC and 18SrRNA were the most suitable genes for different organs and growth stages. This work confirmed the suitable reference genes of flixweed for a relatively accurate gene expression analysis under different experimental conditions.

31852885,Longitudinal transcriptome-wide gene expression analysis of sleep deprivation treatment shows involvement of circadian genes and immune pathways.,"Therapeutic sleep deprivation (SD) rapidly induces robust, transient antidepressant effects in a large proportion of major mood disorder patients suffering from a depressive episode, but underlying biological factors remain poorly understood. Research suggests that these patients may have altered circadian molecular genetic 'clocks' and that SD functions through 'resetting' dysregulated genes; additional factors may be involved, warranting further investigation. Leveraging advances in microarray technology enabling the transcriptome-wide assessment of gene expression, this study aimed to examine gene expression changes accompanying SD and recovery sleep in patients suffering from an episode of depression. Patients (N = 78) and controls (N = 15) underwent SD, with blood taken at the same time of day before SD, after one night of SD and after recovery sleep. A transcriptome-wide gene-by-gene approach was used, with a targeted look also taken at circadian genes. Furthermore, gene set enrichment, and longitudinal gene set analyses including the time point after recovery sleep, were conducted. Circadian genes were significantly affected by SD, with patterns suggesting that molecular clocks of responders and non-responders, as well as patients and controls respond differently to chronobiologic stimuli. Notably, gene set analyses revealed a strong widespread effect of SD on pathways involved in immune function and inflammatory response, such as those involved in cytokine and especially in interleukin signalling. Longitudinal gene set analyses showed that in responders these pathways were upregulated after SD; in non-responders, little response was observed. Our findings emphasize the close relationship between circadian, immune and sleep systems and their link to etiology of depression at the transcriptomic level.",,,Transl Psychiatry,,Foo
31427665,Comparative Tyramide-FISH mapping of the genes controlling flavor and bulb color in Allium species revealed an altered gene order.,"Evolutionarily related species often share a common order of genes along homeologous chromosomes. Here we report the collinearity disruption of genes located on homeologous chromosome 4 in Allium species. Ultra-sensitive fluorescence in situ hybridization with tyramide signal amplification (tyr-FISH) allowed the visualization of the alliinase multigene family, chalcon synthase gene and EST markers on Allium cepa and Allium fistulosum chromosomes. In A. cepa, bulb alliinase, root alliinase (ALL1) and chalcon synthase (CHS-B) genes were located in the long arm but EST markers (API18 and ACM082) were located in the short arm. In A. fistulosum, all the visualized genes and markers were located in the short arm. Moreover, root alliinase genes (ALL1 and AOB249) showed contrast patterns in number of loci. We suppose that the altered order of the genes/markers is the result of a large pericentric inversion. To get insight into the evolution of the chromosome rearrangement, we mapped the bulb alliinase gene in phylogenetically close and distant species. In the taxonomic clade including A. fistulosum, A. altaicum, A. oschaninii and A. pskemense and in phylogenetically distant species A. roylei and A. nutans, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the short arm of chromosome 4 while, in A. cepa and A. schoenoprasum, the bulb alliinase gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 4. These results have encouraging implications for the further tracing of inverted regions in meiosis of interspecific hybrids and studding chromosome evolution. Also, this finding may have a practical benefit as closely related species are actively used for improving onion crop stock.",,,Sci Rep,,Khrustaleva
28594867,"Gene essentiality, conservation index and co-evolution of genes in cyanobacteria.","Cyanobacteria, a group of photosynthetic prokaryotes, dominate the earth with ~ 1015 g wet biomass. Despite diversity in habitats and an ancient origin, cyanobacterial phylum has retained a significant core genome. Cyanobacteria are being explored for direct conversion of solar energy and carbon dioxide into biofuels. For this, efficient cyanobacterial strains will need to be designed via metabolic engineering. This will require identification of target knockouts to channelize the flow of carbon toward the product of interest while minimizing deletions of essential genes. We propose ""Gene Conservation Index"" (GCI) as a quick measure to predict gene essentiality in cyanobacteria. GCI is based on phylogenetic profile of a gene constructed with a reduced dataset of cyanobacterial genomes. GCI is the percentage of organism clusters in which the query gene is present in the reduced dataset. Of the 750 genes deemed to be essential in the experimental study on S. elongatus PCC 7942, we found 494 to be conserved across the phylum which largely comprise of the essential metabolic pathways. On the contrary, the conserved but non-essential genes broadly comprise of genes required under stress conditions. Exceptions to this rule include genes such as the glycogen synthesis and degradation enzymes, deoxyribose-phosphate aldolase (DERA), glucose-6-phosphate 1-dehydrogenase (zwf) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase class1, which are conserved but non-essential. While the essential genes are to be avoided during gene knockout studies as potentially lethal deletions, the non-essential but conserved set of genes could be interesting targets for metabolic engineering. Further, we identify clusters of co-evolving genes (CCG), which provide insights that may be useful in annotation. Principal component analysis (PCA) plots of the CCGs are demonstrated as data visualization tools that are complementary to the conventional heatmaps. Our dataset consists of phylogenetic profiles for 23,643 non-redundant cyanobacterial genes. We believe that the data and the analysis presented here will be a great resource to the scientific community interested in cyanobacteria.",2017-09-19,"Aldehyde-Lyases, Bacterial Proteins, Cyanobacteria, Evolution, Molecular, Fructose-Bisphosphatase, Glucosephosphate Dehydrogenase, Phylogeny, Principal Component Analysis",PLoS One,,Tiruveedula

In this study, 11 candidate birch reference genes (ACT, TUA, TUB, TEF, 18S rRNA, EF1α, GAPDH, UBC, YLS8, SAND, and CDPK) were selected to evaluate the stability of their expression in different tissues and under different abiotic stress conditions. Three statistical algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper) were used to analyze the stability of the 11 candidate reference genes to identify the most appropriate one. The results indicated that EF-1α was the most stable reference gene in different birch tissues, ACT was the most stable reference gene for normal conditions, ACT and TEF were the most stable reference genes for salt stress treatment, TUB was the most stable reference gene for osmotic stress treatment, and ACT was the most appropriate choice in all samples of birch. In conclusion, the most appropriate reference genes varied among different experimental conditions. However, in this study, ACT was the optimum reference gene in all experimental groups, except in the different tissues group. GAPDH was the least stable candidate reference gene in all experimental conditions. In addition, three stress-induced genes (BpGRAS1, BpGRAS16, and BpGRAS19) were chosen to verify the stability of the selected reference genes in different tissues and under salt stress.

26575863,Comparison of gene activation by two TAL effectors from Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis reveals candidate host susceptibility genes in cassava.,"Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis (Xam) employs transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors to promote bacterial growth and symptom formation during infection of cassava. TAL effectors are secreted via the bacterial type III secretion system into plant cells, where they are directed to the nucleus, bind DNA in plant promoters and activate the expression of downstream genes. The DNA-binding activity of TAL effectors is carried out by a central domain which contains a series of repeat variable diresidues (RVDs) that dictate the sequence of bound nucleotides. TAL14Xam668 promotes virulence in Xam strain Xam668 and has been shown to activate multiple cassava genes. In this study, we used RNA sequencing to identify the full target repertoire of TAL14Xam668 in cassava, which includes over 50 genes. A subset of highly up-regulated genes was tested for activation by TAL14CIO151 from Xam strain CIO151. Although TAL14CIO151 and TAL14Xam668 differ by only a single RVD, they display differential activation of gene targets. TAL14CIO151 complements the TAL14Xam668 mutant defect, implying that shared target genes are important for TAL14Xam668 -mediated disease susceptibility. Complementation with closely related TAL effectors is a novel approach to the narrowing down of biologically relevant susceptibility genes of TAL effectors with multiple targets. This study provides an example of how TAL effector target activation by two strains within a single species of Xanthomonas can be dramatically affected by a small change in RVD-nucleotide affinity at a single site, and reflects the parameters of RVD-nucleotide interaction determined using designer TAL effectors in transient systems.",2017-06-19,"Amino Acid Sequence, Bacterial Proteins, Base Sequence, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genetic Association Studies, Genetic Complementation Test, Host-Pathogen Interactions, Manihot, Promoter Regions, Genetic, Reproducibility of Results, Sequence Analysis, RNA, Xanthomonas axonopodis",Mol Plant Pathol,,Cohn
25852171,Identification of stable reference genes in differentiating human pluripotent stem cells.,"Reference genes, often referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs), are frequently used to normalize gene expression data based on the assumption that they are expressed at a constant level in the cells. However, several studies have shown that there may be a large variability in the gene expression levels of HKGs in various cell types. In a previous study, employing human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) subjected to spontaneous differentiation, we observed that the expression of commonly used HKG varied to a degree that rendered them inappropriate to use as reference genes under those experimental settings. Here we present a substantially extended study of the HKG signature in human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC), including nine global gene expression datasets from both hESC and human induced pluripotent stem cells, obtained during directed differentiation toward endoderm-, mesoderm-, and ectoderm derivatives. Sets of stably expressed genes were compiled, and a handful of genes (e.g., EID2, ZNF324B, CAPN10, and RABEP2) were identified as generally applicable reference genes in hPSCs across all cell lines and experimental conditions. The stability in gene expression profiles was confirmed by reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis. Taken together, the current results suggest that differentiating hPSCs have a distinct HKG signature, which in some aspects is different from somatic cell types, and underscore the necessity to validate the stability of reference genes under the actual experimental setup used. In addition, the novel putative HKGs identified in this study can preferentially be used for normalization of gene expression data obtained from differentiating hPSCs.

30667369,Simultaneous silencing of two target genes using virus-induced gene silencing technology in Nicotiana benthamiana.,"Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective strategy for rapid gene function analysis. It is well established that the NAC transcription factor and salicylic acid (SA) signal pathway play essential roles in response to biotic stresses. However, simultaneous silencing of two target genes using VIGS in plants has been rarely reported. Therefore, in this report, we performed VIGS to silence simultaneously the SA-binding protein 2 (NbSABP2) and NbNAC1 in Nicotiana benthamiana to investigate the gene silencing efficiency of simultaneous silencing of two genes. We first cloned the full-length NbNAC1 gene, and the characterization of NbNAC1 was also analysed. Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully amplified. Bacteria liquid PCR confirmed that the combination of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 was successfully inserted into the tobacco rattle virus vector. The results showed that the leaves from the NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 gene-silenced plants collapsed slightly, with browning at the base of petiole or veina. Quantitative real-time PCR results showed that the expression of NbSABP2 and NbNAC1 were significantly reduced in 12 days post silenced plants after tobacco rattle virus infiltration compared with the control plants. Overall, our results suggest that VIGS can be used to silence simultaneously two target genes.",2019-08-21,"Esterases, Gene Silencing, Gene Targeting, Plant Leaves, Plant Proteins, Plant Viruses, Tobacco, Trans-Activators",Z Naturforsch C J Biosci,,Zhu
31715283,Identification of relevant hub genes for early intervention at gene coexpression modules with altered predicted expression in schizophrenia.,"Genetic risk for schizophrenia is due to the joint effect of multiple genes acting mainly at two different processes, prenatal/perinatal neurodevelopment and adolescence/early adulthood synapse maturation. Identification of important genes at the second process is of relevance for early intervention. The aim of this work was to identify gene co-expression modules with altered expression in schizophrenia during adolescence/early adulthood. To this goal, we predicted frontal cortex gene expression in one discovery sample, the largest GWAS of schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, using S-prediXcan, and in one target sample, consisting of 625 schizophrenic patients and 819 controls from Spain, using prediXcan. Prediction models were trained on GTEx frontal cortex expression dataset. In parallel, we identified brain co-expression modules from BrainSpan using WGCNA. Then, we estimated polygenic risk scores based on predicted expression (PE-PRS) for each co-expression module in the target sample, based on PE-PRS model from the discovery sample. This analysis led to the identification of a module with mainly adolescence/adulthood expression whose PE-PRS was significantly associated with schizophrenia. The module was significantly enriched in synaptic processes. Several hub genes at this module are drugabble, according to the drug-gene interaction database, and/or involved in synaptic transmission, such as the voltage-gated ion channels SCN2B and KCNAB2, the calcium calmodulin kinases CAMK2A and CAMK1G, or genes involved in synaptic vesicle cycle, such as DNM1, or SYNGR1. Therefore, identification of this module may be the first step in patient stratification based on biology, as well as in drug design and drug repurposing efforts.",,,Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,10.1016/j.pnpbp.2019.109815,Rodriguez-López
30137329,Phylogenetic Clustering of Genes Reveals Shared Evolutionary Trajectories and Putative Gene Functions.,"Homologous genes in prokaryotes can be described using phylogenetic profiles which summarize their patterns of presence or absence across a set of genomes. Phylogenetic profiles have been used for nearly twenty years to cluster genes based on measures such as the Euclidean distance between profile vectors. However, most approaches do not take into account the phylogenetic relationships amongst the profiled genomes, and overrepresentation of certain taxonomic groups (i.e., pathogenic species with many sequenced representatives) can skew the interpretation of profiles. We propose a new approach that uses a coevolutionary method defined by Pagel to account for the phylogenetic relationships amongst target organisms, and a hierarchical-clustering approach to define sets of genes with common distributions across the organisms. The clusters we obtain using our method show greater evidence of phylogenetic and functional clustering than a recently published approach based on hidden Markov models.

26196856,Effect of carbon monoxide on gene expression in cerebrocortical astrocytes: Validation of reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR.,"Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique to characterize changes in gene expression in complex cellular and tissue processes, such as cytoprotection or inflammation. The accurate assessment of changes in gene expression depends on the selection of adequate internal reference gene(s). Carbon monoxide (CO) affects several metabolic pathways and de novo protein synthesis is crucial in the cellular responses to this gasotransmitter. Herein a selection of commonly used reference genes was analyzed to identify the most suitable internal control genes to evaluate the effect of CO on gene expression in cultured cerebrocortical astrocytes. The cells were exposed to CO by treatment with CORM-A1 (CO releasing molecule A1) and four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of eight putative reference genes. Our results indicate that Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) together with Ppia (peptidylpropyl isomerase A) is the most suitable gene pair for normalization of qRT-PCR results under the experimental conditions used. Pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), Hprt1 (hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase I), Sdha (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, Subunit A), Tbp (TATA box binding protein), Actg1 (actin gamma 1) and Rn18s (18S rRNA) genes presented less stable expression profiles in cultured cortical astrocytes exposed to CORM-A1 for up to 60 min. For validation, we analyzed the effect of CO on the expression of Bdnf and bcl-2. Different results were obtained, depending on the reference genes used. A significant increase in the expression of both genes was found when the results were normalized with Gapdh and Ppia, in contrast with the results obtained when the other genes were used as reference.

Corchorus capsularis, an annual herbaceous fiber crop with predominant biodegradability and renewability, has not been investigated for the stability of reference genes with qRT-PCR. In this study, 11 candidate reference genes were selected and their expression levels were assessed using qRT-PCR. To account for the influence of experimental approach and tissue type, 22 different jute samples were selected from abiotic and biotic stress conditions as well as three different tissue types. The stability of the candidate reference genes was evaluated using geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper programs, and the comprehensive rankings of gene stability were generated by aggregate analysis. For the biotic stress and NaCl stress subsets, ACT7 and RAN were suitable as stable reference genes for gene expression normalization. For the PEG stress subset, UBC, and DnaJ were sufficient for accurate normalization. For the tissues subset, four reference genes TUBβ, UBI, EF1α, and RAN were sufficient for accurate normalization. The selected genes were further validated by comparing expression profiles of WRKY15 in various samples, and two stable reference genes were recommended for accurate normalization of qRT-PCR data.

27936033,Automated Detection of Cancer Associated Genes Using a Combined Fuzzy-Rough-Set-Based F-Information and Water Swirl Algorithm of Human Gene Expression Data.,"This study describes a novel approach to reducing the challenges of highly nonlinear multiclass gene expression values for cancer diagnosis. To build a fruitful system for cancer diagnosis, in this study, we introduced two levels of gene selection such as filtering and embedding for selection of potential genes and the most relevant genes associated with cancer, respectively. The filter procedure was implemented by developing a fuzzy rough set (FR)-based method for redefining the criterion function of f-information (FI) to identify the potential genes without discretizing the continuous gene expression values. The embedded procedure is implemented by means of a water swirl algorithm (WSA), which attempts to optimize the rule set and membership function required to classify samples using a fuzzy-rule-based multiclassification system (FRBMS). Two novel update equations are proposed in WSA, which have better exploration and exploitation abilities while designing a self-learning FRBMS. The efficiency of our new approach was evaluated on 13 multicategory and 9 binary datasets of cancer gene expression. Additionally, the performance of the proposed FRFI-WSA method in designing an FRBMS was compared with existing methods for gene selection and optimization such as genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC) on all the datasets. In the global cancer map with repeated measurements (GCM_RM) dataset, the FRFI-WSA showed the smallest number of 16 most relevant genes associated with cancer using a minimal number of 26 compact rules with the highest classification accuracy (96.45%). In addition, the statistical validation used in this study revealed that the biological relevance of the most relevant genes associated with cancer and their linguistics detected by the proposed FRFI-WSA approach are better than those in the other methods. The simple interpretable rules with most relevant genes and effectively classified samples suggest that the proposed FRFI-WSA approach is reliable for classification of an individual's cancer gene expression data with high precision and therefore it could be helpful for clinicians as a clinical decision support system.",2017-07-26,"Algorithms, Fuzzy Logic, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genetic Testing, Humans, Monte Carlo Method, Neoplasms, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, ROC Curve, Reproducibility of Results",PLoS One,,Ganesh Kumar

30188567,"Identification and characterization of capa and pyrokinin genes in the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera): Gene structure, immunocytochemistry, and differential expression.","CAPA and pyrokinin (PK) neuropeptides are produced from two different genes, capa and pyrokinin, respectively. In this study, we identified and characterized the capa and pyrokinin genes from the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Hemiptera). The capa gene encodes two CAPA-PVK (periviscerokinin) peptides (DAGLFPFPRVamide and EQLIPFPRVamide) and one CAPA-DH (diapause hormone; NGASGNGGLWFGPRLamide). The pyrokinin gene encodes three PK2 peptides (QLVSFRPRLamide, SPPFAPRLamide, and FYAPFSPRLamide). The whole-mounting immunocytochemistry revealed the neurons contained PRXamide-like peptides throughout the cerebral ganglia (CRG), gnathal ganglia (GNG), thoracic ganglia (TG), and abdominal ganglia (AG). A pair of neurosecretory cells in the CRG and three cell clusters in the GNG were found with the axonal projections extended through the lateral side. A pair of immunostained cells were found in the TG, while three pairs of cells were present in the fused AG. Different expression patterns of capa and pyrokinin genes were observed in the CRG-GNG, TG, and AG. The capa gene was highly expressed in the AG tissue, whereas the pyrokinin gene was strongly expressed in the CRG-GNG. Interestingly, different developmental stages showed similar expressions of both genes, with the highest from the first nymph, gradually decreasing to the female adult. Comparison of peptide sequences encoded from pyrokinin genes showed the PK1 peptide is lost in Heteroptera suborders including H. halys, but retained in other suborders. The missing PK1 from the pyrokinin gene might be compensated by CAPA-DH (=PK1-like) produced by the capa gene.",2018-11-05,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Central Nervous System, Female, Hemiptera, Immunohistochemistry, Insect Proteins, Male, Neuropeptides",Arch Insect Biochem Physiol,10.1002/arch.21500,Ahn

25310342,Divergence of gene body DNA methylation and evolution of plant duplicate genes.,"It has been shown that gene body DNA methylation is associated with gene expression. However, whether and how deviation of gene body DNA methylation between duplicate genes can influence their divergence remains largely unexplored. Here, we aim to elucidate the potential role of gene body DNA methylation in the fate of duplicate genes. We identified paralogous gene pairs from Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) genomes and reprocessed their single-base resolution methylome data. We show that methylation in paralogous genes nonlinearly correlates with several gene properties including exon number/gene length, expression level and mutation rate. Further, we demonstrated that divergence of methylation level and pattern in paralogs indeed positively correlate with their sequence and expression divergences. This result held even after controlling for other confounding factors known to influence the divergence of paralogs. We observed that methylation level divergence might be more relevant to the expression divergence of paralogs than methylation pattern divergence. Finally, we explored the mechanisms that might give rise to the divergence of gene body methylation in paralogs. We found that exonic methylation divergence more closely correlates with expression divergence than intronic methylation divergence. We show that genomic environments (e.g., flanked by transposable elements and repetitive sequences) of paralogs generated by various duplication mechanisms are associated with the methylation divergence of paralogs. Overall, our results suggest that the changes in gene body DNA methylation could provide another avenue for duplicate genes to develop differential expression patterns and undergo different evolutionary fates in plant genomes.

20931200,"Recommended nomenclature for five mammalian carboxylesterase gene families: human, mouse, and rat genes and proteins.","Mammalian carboxylesterase (CES or Ces) genes encode enzymes that participate in xenobiotic, drug, and lipid metabolism in the body and are members of at least five gene families. Tandem duplications have added more genes for some families, particularly for mouse and rat genomes, which has caused confusion in naming rodent Ces genes. This article describes a new nomenclature system for human, mouse, and rat carboxylesterase genes that identifies homolog gene families and allocates a unique name for each gene. The guidelines of human, mouse, and rat gene nomenclature committees were followed and ""CES"" (human) and ""Ces"" (mouse and rat) root symbols were used followed by the family number (e.g., human CES1). Where multiple genes were identified for a family or where a clash occurred with an existing gene name, a letter was added (e.g., human CES4A; mouse and rat Ces1a) that reflected gene relatedness among rodent species (e.g., mouse and rat Ces1a). Pseudogenes were named by adding ""P"" and a number to the human gene name (e.g., human CES1P1) or by using a new letter followed by ps for mouse and rat Ces pseudogenes (e.g., Ces2d-ps). Gene transcript isoforms were named by adding the GenBank accession ID to the gene symbol (e.g., human CES1_AB119995 or mouse Ces1e_BC019208). This nomenclature improves our understanding of human, mouse, and rat CES/Ces gene families and facilitates research into the structure, function, and evolution of these gene families. It also serves as a model for naming CES genes from other mammalian species.",2011-02-16,"Amino Acid Sequence, Animals, Carboxylesterase, Genes, Humans, Mice, Multigene Family, Protein Isoforms, Pseudogenes, Rats, Sequence Homology, Terminology as Topic",Mamm Genome,,Holmes
26791837,Comparative mapping of powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 and functional characterization of resistance-related genes in wheat.,"The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 was physically and comparatively mapped by newly developed markers. Seven candidate genes were verified to be required for Pm21 -mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew. Pm21, a gene derived from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum, has been transferred into common wheat and widely utilized in wheat resistance breeding for powdery mildew. Previously, Pm21 has been located to the bin FL0.45-0.58 of 6VS by using deletion stocks. However, its fine mapping is still a hard work. In the present study, 30 gene-derived 6VS-specific markers were obtained based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza and Triticeae, and then physically and comparatively mapped in the bin FL0.45-0.58 and its nearby chromosome region. According to the maps, the bin FL0.45-0.58 carrying Pm21 was closely flanked by the markers 6VS-03 and 6VS-23, which further narrowed the orthologous regions to 1.06 Mb in Brachypodium and 1.38 Mb in rice, respectively. Among the conserved genes shared by Brachypodium and rice, four serine/threonine protein kinase genes (DvMPK1, DvMLPK, DvUPK and DvPSYR1), one protein phosphatase gene (DvPP2C) and two transcription factor genes (DvGATA and DvWHY) were confirmed to be required for Pm21-mediated resistance to wheat powdery mildew by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) and transcriptional pattern analyses. In summary, this study gives new insights into the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus and the disease resistance pathways mediated by Pm21.",2016-07-22,"Ascomycota, Brachypodium, DNA, Plant, Disease Resistance, Genes, Plant, Genetic Markers, Oryza, Physical Chromosome Mapping, Plant Diseases, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Triticum",Theor Appl Genet,,He
30002337,Ensemble Consensus-Guided Unsupervised Feature Selection to Identify Huntington's Disease-Associated Genes.,"Due to the complexity of the pathological mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases, traditional differentially-expressed gene selection methods cannot detect disease-associated genes accurately. Recent studies have shown that consensus-guided unsupervised feature selection (CGUFS) performs well in feature selection for identifying disease-associated genes. Since the random initialization of the feature selection matrix in CGUFS results in instability of the final disease-associated gene set, for the purposes of this study we proposed an ensemble method based on CGUFS-namely, ensemble consensus-guided unsupervised feature selection (ECGUFS) in order to further improve the accuracy of disease-associated genes and the stability of feature gene sets. We also proposed a bagging integration strategy to integrate the results of CGUFS. Lastly, we conducted experiments with Huntington's disease RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data and obtained the final feature gene set, where we detected 287 disease-associated genes. Enrichment analysis on these genes has shown that postsynaptic density and the postsynaptic membrane, synapse, and cell junction are all affected during the disease's progression. However, ECGUFS greatly improved the accuracy of disease-associated gene prediction and the stability of the disease-associated gene set. We conducted a classification of samples with labels based on the linear support vector machine with 10-fold cross-validation. The average accuracy is 0.9, which suggests the effectiveness of the feature gene set.",,,Genes (Basel),,Guo
31712655,"Oncogenes, tumor suppressor and differentiation genes represent the oldest human gene classes and evolve concurrently.","Earlier we showed that human genome contains many evolutionarily young or novel genes with tumor-specific or tumor-predominant expression. We suggest calling such genes Tumor Specifically Expressed, Evolutionarily New (TSEEN) genes. In this paper we performed a study of the evolutionary ages of different classes of human genes, using homology searches in genomes of different taxa in human lineage. We discovered that different classes of human genes have different evolutionary ages and confirmed the existence of TSEEN gene classes. On the other hand, we found that oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes and differentiation genes are among the oldest gene classes in humans and their evolution occurs concurrently. These findings confirm non-trivial predictions made by our hypothesis of the possible evolutionary role of hereditary tumors. The results may be important for better understanding of tumor biology.

26935416,Transcriptomic Analysis Identifies Candidate Genes and Gene Sets Controlling the Response of Porcine Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells to Poly I:C Stimulation.,"Polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a synthetic dsRNA analog, has been demonstrated to have stimulatory effects similar to viral dsRNA. To gain deep knowledge of the host transcriptional response of pigs to poly I:C stimulation, in the present study, we cultured and stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of piglets of one Chinese indigenous breed (Dapulian) and one modern commercial breed (Landrace) with poly I:C, and compared their transcriptional profiling using RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq). Our results indicated that poly I:C stimulation can elicit significantly differentially expressed (DE) genes in Dapulian (g = 290) as well as Landrace (g = 85). We also performed gene set analysis using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) package, and identified some significantly enriched gene sets in Dapulian (g = 18) and Landrace (g = 21). Most of the shared DE genes and gene sets were immune-related, and may play crucial rules in the immune response of poly I:C stimulation. In addition, we detected large sets of significantly DE genes and enriched gene sets when comparing the gene expression profile between the two breeds, including control and poly I:C stimulation groups. Besides immune-related functions, some of the DE genes and gene sets between the two breeds were involved in development and growth of various tissues, which may be correlated with the different characteristics of the two breeds. The DE genes and gene sets detected herein provide crucial information towards understanding the immune regulation of antiviral responses, and the molecular mechanisms of different genetic resistance to viral infection, in modern and indigenous pigs.",2017-11-16,"Animals, Breeding, Chromosome Mapping, Computational Biology, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Ontology, Genetic Association Studies, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Leukocytes, Mononuclear, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Poly I-C, Reproducibility of Results, Swine, Transcriptome",G3 (Bethesda),,Wang

29616063,MorphDB: Prioritizing Genes for Specialized Metabolism Pathways and Gene Ontology Categories in Plants.,"Recent times have seen an enormous growth of ""omics"" data, of which high-throughput gene expression data are arguably the most important from a functional perspective. Despite huge improvements in computational techniques for the functional classification of gene sequences, common similarity-based methods often fall short of providing full and reliable functional information. Recently, the combination of comparative genomics with approaches in functional genomics has received considerable interest for gene function analysis, leveraging both gene expression based guilt-by-association methods and annotation efforts in closely related model organisms. Besides the identification of missing genes in pathways, these methods also typically enable the discovery of biological regulators (i.e., transcription factors or signaling genes). A previously built guilt-by-association method is MORPH, which was proven to be an efficient algorithm that performs particularly well in identifying and prioritizing missing genes in plant metabolic pathways. Here, we present MorphDB, a resource where MORPH-based candidate genes for large-scale functional annotations (Gene Ontology, MapMan bins) are integrated across multiple plant species. Besides a gene centric query utility, we present a comparative network approach that enables researchers to efficiently browse MORPH predictions across functional gene sets and species, facilitating efficient gene discovery and candidate gene prioritization. MorphDB is available at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/morphdb/morphDB/index/.

26393928,Optimal Reference Genes for Gene Expression Normalization in Trichomonas vaginalis.,"Trichomonas vaginalis is the etiologic agent of trichomonosis, the most common non-viral sexually transmitted disease worldwide. This infection is associated with several health consequences, including cervical and prostate cancers and HIV acquisition. Gene expression analysis has been facilitated because of available genome sequences and large-scale transcriptomes in T. vaginalis, particularly using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), one of the most used methods for molecular studies. Reference genes for normalization are crucial to ensure the accuracy of this method. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic validation of reference genes has not been performed for T. vaginalis. In this study, the transcripts of nine candidate reference genes were quantified using qRT-PCR under different cultivation conditions, and the stability of these genes was compared using the geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. The most stable reference genes were α-tubulin, actin and DNATopII, and, conversely, the widely used T. vaginalis reference genes GAPDH and β-tubulin were less stable. The PFOR gene was used to validate the reliability of the use of these candidate reference genes. As expected, the PFOR gene was upregulated when the trophozoites were cultivated with ferrous ammonium sulfate when the DNATopII, α-tubulin and actin genes were used as normalizing gene. By contrast, the PFOR gene was downregulated when the GAPDH gene was used as an internal control, leading to misinterpretation of the data. These results provide an important starting point for reference gene selection and gene expression analysis with qRT-PCR studies of T. vaginalis.

26124453,Validation of endogenous control reference genes for normalizing gene expression studies in endometrial carcinoma.,"Real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is a powerful technique used for the relative quantification of target genes, using reference (housekeeping) genes for normalization to ensure the generation of accurate and robust data. A systematic examination of the suitability of endogenous reference genes for gene expression studies in endometrial cancer tissues is absent. The aims of this study were therefore to identify and evaluate from the thirty-two possible reference genes from a TaqMan(®) array panel their suitability as an internal control gene. The mathematical software packages geNorm qBasePLUS identified Pumilio homolog 1 (Drosophila) (PUM1), ubiquitin C (UBC), phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1), mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19) and peptidylpropyl isomerase A (cyclophilin A) (PPIA) as the best reference gene combination, whilst NormFinder identified MRPL19 as the best single reference gene, with importin 8 (IPO8) and PPIA being the best combination of two reference genes. BestKeeper ranked MRPL19 as the most stably expressed gene. In addition, the study was validated by examining the relative expression of a test gene, which encodes the cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1). A significant difference in CB1 mRNA expression between malignant and normal endometrium using MRPL19, PPIA, and IP08 in combination was observed. The use of MRPL19, IPO8 and PPIA was identified as the best reference gene combination for the normalization of gene expression levels in endometrial carcinoma. This study demonstrates that the arbitrary selection of endogenous control reference genes for normalization in qRT-PCR studies of endometrial carcinoma, without validation, risks the production of inaccurate data and should therefore be discouraged.

The pathogenical mechanism of myocardium remodeling remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to identify key genes and networks for myocardium remodeling following ischemia‑reperfusion (IR). First, the mRNA expression data from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were downloaded to identify differences in mRNA expression of the IR heart at days 2 and 7. Then, weighted gene co‑expression network analysis, hierarchical clustering, protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway were used to identify key genes and networks for the heart remodeling process following IR. A total of 3,321 differentially expressed genes were identified during the heart remodeling process. A total of 6 modules were identified through gene co‑expression network analysis. GO and KEGG analysis results suggested that each module represented a different biological function and was associated with different pathways. Finally, hub genes of each module were identified by PPI network construction. The present study revealed that heart remodeling following IR is a complicated process, involving extracellular matrix organization, neural development, apoptosis and energy metabolism. The dysregulated genes, including SRC proto‑oncogene, non‑receptor tyrosine kinase, discs large MAGUK scaffold protein 1, ATP citrate lyase, RAN, member RAS oncogene family, tumor protein p53, and polo like kinase 2, may be essential for heart remodeling following IR and may be used as potential targets for the inhibition of heart remodeling following acute myocardial infarction.",2018-10-18,"Animals, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulatory Networks, Myocardial Reperfusion Injury, Myocardium, Rats",Mol Med Rep,,Guo

24076355,Identification of differentially-expressed genes potentially implicated in drought response in pitaya (Hylocereus undatus) by suppression subtractive hybridization and cDNA microarray analysis.,"Drought is one of the most severe threats to the growth, development and yield of plant. In order to unravel the molecular basis underlying the high tolerance of pitaya (Hylocereus undatus) to drought stress, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray approaches were firstly combined to identify the potential important or novel genes involved in the plant responses to drought stress. The forward (drought over drought-free) and reverse (drought-free over drought) suppression subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed using in vitro shoots of cultivar 'Zihonglong' exposed to drought stress and drought-free (control). A total of 2112 clones, among which half were from either forward or reverse SSH library, were randomly picked up to construct a pitaya cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis was carried out to verify the expression fluctuations of this set of clones upon drought treatment compared with the controls. A total of 309 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), 153 from forward library and 156 from reverse library, were obtained, and 138 unique ESTs were identified after sequencing by clustering and blast analyses, which included genes that had been previously reported as responsive to water stress as well as some functionally unknown genes. Thirty six genes were mapped to 47 KEGG pathways, including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism of pitaya. Expression analysis of the selected ESTs by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) corroborated the results of differential screening. Moreover, time-course expression patterns of these selected ESTs further confirmed that they were closely responsive to drought treatment. Among the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), many are related to stress tolerances including drought tolerance. Thereby, the mechanism of drought tolerance of this pitaya genotype is a very complex physiological and biochemical process, in which multiple metabolism pathways and many genes were implicated. The data gained herein provide an insight into the mechanism underlying the drought stress tolerance of pitaya, as well as may facilitate the screening of candidate genes for drought tolerance.

25617468,Methylation of microRNA genes regulates gene expression in bisexual flower development in andromonoecious poplar.,"Previous studies showed sex-specific DNA methylation and expression of candidate genes in bisexual flowers of andromonoecious poplar, but the regulatory relationship between methylation and microRNAs (miRNAs) remains unclear. To investigate whether the methylation of miRNA genes regulates gene expression in bisexual flower development, the methylome, microRNA, and transcriptome were examined in female and male flowers of andromonoecious poplar. 27 636 methylated coding genes and 113 methylated miRNA genes were identified. In the coding genes, 64.5% of the methylated reads mapped to the gene body region; by contrast, 60.7% of methylated reads in miRNA genes mainly mapped in the 5' and 3' flanking regions. CHH methylation showed the highest methylation levels and CHG showed the lowest methylation levels. Correlation analysis showed a significant, negative, strand-specific correlation of methylation and miRNA gene expression (r=0.79, P <0.05). The methylated miRNA genes included eight long miRNAs (lmiRNAs) of 24 nucleotides and 11 miRNAs related to flower development. miRNA172b might play an important role in the regulation of bisexual flower development-related gene expression in andromonoecious poplar, via modification of methylation. Gynomonoecious, female, and male poplars were used to validate the methylation patterns of the miRNA172b gene, implying that hyper-methylation in andromonoecious and gynomonoecious poplar might function as an important regulator in bisexual flower development. Our data provide a useful resource for the study of flower development in poplar and improve our understanding of the effect of epigenetic regulation on genes other than protein-coding genes.

31611957,Distinct expression pattern and prognostic values of pituitary tumor transforming gene family genes in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Members of the pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG) family, including PTTG1, PTTG2 and PTTG3P, exhibit pivotal roles in the onset and progression of certain types of human cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, a systematic study regarding the expression pattern and the prognostic values of PTTG family genes in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains to be performed. The expression levels of PTTG family genes in NSCLC were successively determined using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis, UALCAN and Oncomine databases. Subsequently, the Kaplan-Meier plotter database was used to assess the prognostic value of the PTTG family genes in patients with NSCLC, and to determine the associations between PTTG expression levels and the prognosis of patients based on different clinicopathological features, including cancer stage, grade, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, lymph node status, smoking history, and sex. PTTG1 was identified to be significantly upregulated in NSCLC in all three databases, whereas PTTG2 and PTTG3P were significantly upregulated in NSCLC in only the UALCAN database. Patients with NSCLC with higher expression levels of the three PTTG genes demonstrated shorter overall survival times. In summary, the results of the present study suggested that increased expression of PTTG family genes may serve as promising prognostic biomarkers for patients with NSCLC.",,,Oncol Lett,,Yang
27186328,"Genes, environment and gene expression in colon tissue: a pathway approach to determining functionality.","Genetic and environmental factors have been shown to work together to alter cancer risk. In this study we evaluate previously identified gene and lifestyle interactions in a candidate pathway that were associated with colon cancer risk to see if these interactions altered gene expression. We analyzed non-tumor RNA-seq data from 144 colon cancer patients who had genotype, recent cigarette smoking, diet, body mass index (BMI), and recent aspirin/non-steroidal anti-inflammatory use data. Using a false discovery rate of 0.1, we evaluated differential gene expression between high and low levels of lifestyle exposure and genotypes using DESeq2. Thirteen pathway genes and 17 SNPs within those genes were associated with altered expression of other genes in the pathway. BMI, NSAIDs use and dietary components of the oxidative balance score (OBS) also were associated with altered gene expression. SNPs previously identified as interacting with these lifestyle factors, altered expression of pathway genes. NSAIDs interacted with 10 genes (15 SNPs) within those genes to alter expression of 28 pathway genes; recent cigarette smoking interacted with seven genes (nine SNPs) to alter expression of 27 genes. BMI interacted with FLT1, KDR, SEPN1, TERT, TXNRD2, and VEGFA to alter expression of eight genes. Three genes (five SNPs) interacted with OBS to alter expression of 12 genes. These data provide support for previously identified lifestyle and gene interactions associated with colon cancer in that they altered expression of key pathway genes. The need to consider lifestyle factors in conjunction with genetic factors is illustrated. ",2016-05-17,,Int J Mol Epidemiol Genet,,Slattery
23382867,Identification of human HK genes and gene expression regulation study in cancer from transcriptomics data analysis.,"The regulation of gene expression is essential for eukaryotes, as it drives the processes of cellular differentiation and morphogenesis, leading to the creation of different cell types in multicellular organisms. RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) provides researchers with a powerful toolbox for characterization and quantification of transcriptome. Many different human tissue/cell transcriptome datasets coming from RNA-Seq technology are available on public data resource. The fundamental issue here is how to develop an effective analysis method to estimate expression pattern similarities between different tumor tissues and their corresponding normal tissues. We define the gene expression pattern from three directions: 1) expression breadth, which reflects gene expression on/off status, and mainly concerns ubiquitously expressed genes; 2) low/high or constant/variable expression genes, based on gene expression level and variation; and 3) the regulation of gene expression at the gene structure level. The cluster analysis indicates that gene expression pattern is higher related to physiological condition rather than tissue spatial distance. Two sets of human housekeeping (HK) genes are defined according to cell/tissue types, respectively. To characterize the gene expression pattern in gene expression level and variation, we firstly apply improved K-means algorithm and a gene expression variance model. We find that cancer-associated HK genes (a HK gene is specific in cancer group, while not in normal group) are expressed higher and more variable in cancer condition than in normal condition. Cancer-associated HK genes prefer to AT-rich genes, and they are enriched in cell cycle regulation related functions and constitute some cancer signatures. The expression of large genes is also avoided in cancer group. These studies will help us understand which cell type-specific patterns of gene expression differ among different cell types, and particularly for cancer.",2013-09-04,"Algorithms, Base Sequence, Cell Lineage, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Essential, Humans, Neoplasms, Sequence Analysis, RNA",PLoS One,,Chen

24810421,Sequencing and validation of reference genes to analyze endogenous gene expression and quantify yellow dwarf viruses using RT-qPCR in viruliferous Rhopalosiphum padi.,"The bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi), an important pest of cereal crops, not only directly sucks sap from plants, but also transmits a number of plant viruses, collectively the yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs). For quantifying changes in gene expression in vector aphids, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a touchstone method, but the selection and validation of housekeeping genes (HKGs) as reference genes to normalize the expression level of endogenous genes of the vector and for exogenous genes of the virus in the aphids is critical to obtaining valid results. Such an assessment has not been done, however, for R. padi and YDVs. Here, we tested three algorithms (GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper) to assess the suitability of candidate reference genes (EF-1α, ACT1, GAPDH, 18S rRNA) in 6 combinations of YDV and vector aphid morph. EF-1α and ACT1 together or in combination with GAPDH or with GAPDH and 18S rRNA could confidently be used to normalize virus titre and expression levels of endogenous genes in winged or wingless R. padi infected with Barley yellow dwarf virus isolates (BYDV)-PAV and BYDV-GAV. The use of only one reference gene, whether the most stably expressed (EF-1α) or the least stably expressed (18S rRNA), was not adequate for obtaining valid relative expression data from the RT-qPCR. Because of discrepancies among values for changes in relative expression obtained using 3 regions of the same gene, different regions of an endogenous aphid gene, including each terminus and the middle, should be analyzed at the same time with RT-qPCR. Our results highlight the necessity of choosing the best reference genes to obtain valid experimental data and provide several HKGs for relative quantification of virus titre in YDV-viruliferous aphids.

However, the mechanistic details of its biosynthesis pathway are still vague. To clear this ambiguity, we performed de novo transcriptome assembly and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling analyses of F. multiflora using the Illumina RNA-seq system. RNA-seq generated approximately 70 million high-quality reads that were assembled into 65,653 unigenes (mean length=750 bp), including 26,670 clusters and 38,983 singletons. A total of 48,173 (73.4%) unigenes were annotated using public protein databases with a cut-off e-value above 10(-5). Furthermore, we investigated the transcriptome difference of four different F. multiflora tissues using DGE profiling. Variations in gene expression were identified based on comparisons of transcriptomes from various parts of a high-level THSG- and a low-level THSG-producing F. multiflora plant. Clusters with similar differential expression patterns and enriched metabolic pathways with regard to the differentially expressed genes putatively involved in THSG biosynthesis were revealed for the first time.

In this study, the stability of nine housekeeping genes of the sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) Mediterranean were evaluated in various conditions by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction using geNorm and Normfinder programs. Both programs suggested alpha-tubulin/ubiquitin and 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA the most stable genes for bacterium- and insecticide-treated whiteflies, respectively. For developmental stages, organs, and the samples including salivary glands and the whole body, transcription initiation factor TFIID subunit was calculated as the most stably expressed gene by both programs. In addition, we compared the RNA-seq data with the results of geNorm and Normfinder and found that the stable genes revealed by RNA-seq analysis were also the ERGs recommended by geNorm and Normfinder. Furthermore, the use of the most stable gene suggested by RNA-seq analysis as an ERG produced similar gene expression patterns compared with results generated from the normalization against the most stable gene selected by geNorm and Normfinder and multiple genes recommended by geNorm.

30842288,Environment-dependent fitness gains can be driven by horizontal gene transfer of transporter-encoding genes.,"Many microbes acquire metabolites in a ""feeding"" process where complex polymers are broken down in the environment to their subunits. The subsequent uptake of soluble metabolites by a cell, sometimes called osmotrophy, is facilitated by transporter proteins. As such, the diversification of osmotrophic microorganisms is closely tied to the diversification of transporter functions. Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) has been suggested to produce genetic variation that can lead to adaptation, allowing lineages to acquire traits and expand niche ranges. Transporter genes often encode single-gene phenotypes and tend to have low protein-protein interaction complexity and, as such, are potential candidates for HGT. Here we test the idea that HGT has underpinned the expansion of metabolic potential and substrate utilization via transfer of transporter-encoding genes. Using phylogenomics, we identify seven cases of transporter-gene HGT between fungal phyla, and investigate compatibility, localization, function, and fitness consequences when these genes are expressed in ",2019-05-31,"Biological Evolution, Evolution, Molecular, Fungi, Gene Transfer, Horizontal, Genetic Fitness, Genome, Membrane Transport Proteins, Phenotype, Phylogeny, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,Milner

One example is the Bmp16 gene, a paralog of the developmental key genes Bmp2 and -4. We focus on the Bmp2/4/16 group of genes to study the evolutionary dynamics following gen(om)e duplications with special emphasis on the poorly studied Bmp16 gene. We reveal the presence of Bmp16 in chondrichthyans in addition to previously reported teleost fishes and reptiles. Using comprehensive, vertebrate-wide gene sampling, our phylogenetic analysis complemented with synteny analyses suggests that Bmp2, -4 and -16 are remnants of a gene quartet that originated during the two rounds of whole-genome duplication (2R-WGD) early in vertebrate evolution. We confirm that Bmp16 genes were lost independently in at least three lineages (mammals, archelosaurs and amphibians) and report that they have elevated rates of sequence evolution. This finding agrees with their more ""flexible"" deployment during development; while Bmp16 has limited embryonic expression domains in the cloudy catshark, it is broadly expressed in the green anole lizard. Our study illustrates the dynamics of gene family evolution by integrating insights from sequence diversification, gene repertoire changes, and shuffling of expression domains.",,,Sci Rep,,Feiner
31564431,Adipose Tissue Gene Expression Associations Reveal Hundreds of Candidate Genes for Cardiometabolic Traits.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic loci associated with cardiometabolic traits including type 2 diabetes (T2D), lipid levels, body fat distribution, and adiposity, although most causal genes remain unknown. We used subcutaneous adipose tissue RNA-seq data from 434 Finnish men from the METSIM study to identify 9,687 primary and 2,785 secondary cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL; <1 Mb from TSS, FDR < 1%). Compared to primary eQTL signals, secondary eQTL signals were located further from transcription start sites, had smaller effect sizes, and were less enriched in adipose tissue regulatory elements compared to primary signals. Among 2,843 cardiometabolic GWAS signals, 262 colocalized by LD and conditional analysis with 318 transcripts as primary and conditionally distinct secondary cis-eQTLs, including some across ancestries. Of cardiometabolic traits examined for adipose tissue eQTL colocalizations, waist-hip ratio (WHR) and circulating lipid traits had the highest percentage of colocalized eQTLs (15% and 14%, respectively). Among alleles associated with increased cardiometabolic GWAS risk, approximately half (53%) were associated with decreased gene expression level. Mediation analyses of colocalized genes and cardiometabolic traits within the 434 individuals provided further evidence that gene expression influences variant-trait associations.

30077764,Genome-wide analysis of Eucalyptus grandis WRKY genes family and their expression profiling in response to hormone and abiotic stress treatment.,"The WRKY transcription factors, a large family of proteins in plants, are involved in multiple developmental and biological processes including response to phytohormones and abiotic stress. However, little information is available regarding the WRKY family in Eucalyptus, which has been the most widely planted hardwood trees in tropical and subtropical areas. In this study, a total of 79 WRKY genes (named as EgrWRKY1-79) were identified from the Eucalyptus grandis genome and classified into three main groups according to the phylogenetic analysis, which was further supported by their gene structure and conserved motifs. Of which, 28 EgrWRKYs were involved in tandem duplication but none for segmental duplication, indicating that tandem duplication was the main cause for the expansion of WRKY gene family in E. grandis. Subsequently, expression profiles of EgrWRKY genes in eight different tissues and in response to treatments of three hormones (SA, JA, and BR) and two abiotic stresses (salt and cold) were analyzed. The results revealed that the EgrWRKY genes had differential expression in their transcript abundance and they were differentially expressed in response to plant hormones and salt and cold stresses, suggesting their contributions to plant developmental processes as well as abiotic stresses with the involvement of hormone signaling transduction. Taken together, these findings will increase our understanding of EgrWRKY gene family involved in abiotic stresses and hormone signaling transduction, and also will provide some stress-responsive candidate EgrWRKY genes for further characterization of their functions in Eucalyptus.",2018-10-22,"Chromosomes, Plant, Eucalyptus, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Multigene Family, Phylogeny, Plant Growth Regulators, Plant Proteins, Stress, Physiological, Tissue Distribution, Transcription Factors",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.08.003,Fan

Therefore, we performed a genome-wide sequence analysis of T1D candidate genes to identify embedded Alu elements within these genes. We observed significant enrichment of Alu elements within the T1D genes (p-value < 10e-16), which highlights their importance in T1D. Functional annotation of T1D genes harboring Alus revealed significant enrichment for immune-mediated processes (p-value < 10e-6). We also identified eight T1D genes harboring inverted Alus (IRAlus) within their 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) that are known to regulate the expression of host mRNAs by generating double stranded RNA duplexes. Our in silico analysis predicted the formation of duplex structures by IRAlus within the 3'UTRs of T1D genes. We propose that IRAlus might be involved in regulating the expression levels of the host T1D genes. ",2015-07-18,,Genes (Basel),,Kaur

Antibiotics released into the environment via wastewater could accelerate the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes in the surrounding environment. In this study, we quantified the occurrence of sulfonamides, sulfonamide-resistant microorganisms and resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm in northern Taiwan and its surrounding natural water bodies and soils. Sulfonamide levels were similar in the receiving downstream and upstream river water. However, the prevalence of sulfonamide-resistant bacteria and resistance genes, as analyzed by cultivation-dependent and -independent molecular approaches, was significantly greater in the downstream compared to the upstream river water samples. Barcoded-pyrosequencing revealed a highly diverse bacterial community structure in each sample. However, the sequence identity of the sulfonamide resistance gene sul1 in the wastewater and downstream environment samples was nearly identical (99-100%). The sul1 gene, which is genetically linked to class 1 integrons, was dominant in the downstream water bodies and soils. In conclusion, the increased prevalence of sulfonamide resistance genes in the wastewater from a swine farm, independent of the persistent presence of sulfonamides, could be a potential source of resistant gene pools in the surrounding environment.

25949096,"Identifying driver genes in cancer by triangulating gene expression, gene location, and survival data.","Driver genes are directly responsible for oncogenesis and identifying them is essential in order to fully understand the mechanisms of cancer. However, it is difficult to delineate them from the larger pool of genes that are deregulated in cancer (ie, passenger genes). In order to address this problem, we developed an approach called TRIAngulating Gene Expression (TRIAGE through clinico-genomic intersects). Here, we present a refinement of this approach incorporating a new scoring methodology to identify putative driver genes that are deregulated in cancer. TRIAGE triangulates - or integrates - three levels of information: gene expression, gene location, and patient survival. First, TRIAGE identifies regions of deregulated expression (ie, expression footprints) by deriving a newly established measure called the Local Singular Value Decomposition (LSVD) score for each locus. Driver genes are then distinguished from passenger genes using dual survival analyses. Incorporating measurements of gene expression and weighting them according to the LSVD weight of each tumor, these analyses are performed using the genes located in significant expression footprints. Here, we first use simulated data to characterize the newly established LSVD score. We then present the results of our application of this refined version of TRIAGE to gene expression data from five cancer types. This refined version of TRIAGE not only allowed us to identify known prominent driver genes, such as MMP1, IL8, and COL1A2, but it also led us to identify several novel ones. These results illustrate that TRIAGE complements existing tools, allows for the identification of genes that drive cancer and could perhaps elucidate potential future targets of novel anticancer therapeutics.

25060099,In silico analysis of miRNA-mediated gene regulation in OCA and OA genes.,"Albinism is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder due to low secretion of melanin. The oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) and ocular albinism (OA) genes are responsible for melanin production and also act as a potential targets for miRNAs. The role of miRNA is to inhibit the protein synthesis partially or completely by binding with the 3'UTR of the mRNA thus regulating gene expression. In this analysis, we predicted the genetic variation that occurred in 3'UTR of the transcript which can be a reason for low melanin production thus causing albinism. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 3'UTR cause more new binding sites for miRNA which binds with mRNA which leads to inhibit the translation process either partially or completely. The SNPs in the mRNA of OCA and OA genes can create new binding sites for miRNA which may control the gene expression and lead to hypopigmentation. We have developed a computational procedure to determine the SNPs in the 3'UTR region of mRNA of OCA (TYR, OCA2, TYRP1 and SLC45A2) and OA (GPR143) genes which will be a potential cause for albinism. We identified 37 SNPs in five genes that are predicted to create 87 new binding sites on mRNA, which may lead to abrogation of the translation process. Expression analysis confirms that these genes are highly expressed in skin and eye regions. It is well supported by enrichment analysis that these genes are mainly involved in eye pigmentation and melanin biosynthesis process. The network analysis also shows how the genes are interacting and expressing in a complex network.

Therefore, it is urgently demanded to screen for novel biomarkers and drug targets for TNBC. In this study, we obtained four independent data sets (GSE76250, GSE31448, GSE43358, and METABRIC) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and the cBioPortal website. In the GSE76250 data set, 890 differentially expressed genes were identified and weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed based on them.

The present study aimed to investigate gene alterations in patients with spinal cord injury and to further examine the mechanisms underlying NP following SCI. The GSE69901 gene expression profile was downloaded from the public Gene Expression Omnibus database. Samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from 12 patients with intractable NP and 13 control patients without pain were analyzed to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), followed by functional enrichment analysis and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network construction. In addition, a transcriptional regulation network was constructed and functional gene clustering was performed. A total of 70 upregulated and 61 downregulated DEGs were identified in the PBMC samples from patients with NP.

25280936,fabp4 is central to eight obesity associated genes: a functional gene network-based polymorphic study.,"Network study on genes and proteins offers functional basics of the complexity of gene and protein, and its interacting partners. The gene fatty acid-binding protein 4 (fabp4) is found to be highly expressed in adipose tissue, and is one of the most abundant proteins in mature adipocytes. Our investigations on functional modules of fabp4 provide useful information on the functional genes interacting with fabp4, their biochemical properties and their regulatory functions. The present study shows that there are eight set of candidate genes: acp1, ext2, insr, lipe, ostf1, sncg, usp15, and vim that are strongly and functionally linked up with fabp4. Gene ontological analysis of network modules of fabp4 provides an explicit idea on the functional aspect of fabp4 and its interacting nodes. The hierarchal mapping on gene ontology indicates gene specific processes and functions as well as their compartmentalization in tissues. The fabp4 along with its interacting genes are involved in lipid metabolic activity and are integrated in multi-cellular processes of tissues and organs. They also have important protein/enzyme binding activity. Our study elucidated disease-associated nsSNP prediction for fabp4 and it is interesting to note that there are four rsID׳s (rs1051231, rs3204631, rs140925685 and rs141169989) with disease allelic variation (T104P, T126P, G27D and G90V respectively). On the whole, our gene network analysis presents a clear insight about the interactions and functions associated with fabp4 gene network.

The objective of this study is the selection of a set of optimal reference genes in Bifidobacterium adolescentis gene expression studies under bile exposure. B adolescentis is a particularly abundant species in the human adults gut microbiota, exerting relevant probiotic activities. In the gastrointestinal tract, bile represents a hard challenge for bacterial survival, because of its toxic effect. The natural exposure to bile in the colonic environment induces cells adaptation and tolerance mechanisms in bifidobacteria, which determines changes in gene expression profile, influencing the expression levels of housekeeping genes. In this context, the stability of 9 putative reference genes (cysS, purB, recA, rpoB-L, GADPH-R, 16S rRNA, glnA1, gyrA2, sdhA) was examined in B. adolescentis exposed to bile extract, using two different software (BestKeeper and NormFinder). Both algorithms identified gyrA2 and sdhA as the most stable genes under our experimental conditions, while 16S rRNA is the least reliable HKGs. To our best knowledge, this is the first attempt to validate reference genes in Bifidobacterium spp. and the results offer an appropriate set of reference genes suitable for qRT-PCR studies on B. adolescentis strains under bile stress.

30334767,Identification of Minimum Set of Master Regulatory Genes in Gene Regulatory Networks.,"Identification of master regulatory genes is one of the primary challenges in systems biology. The minimum dominating set problem is a powerful paradigm in analyzing such complex networks. In these models, genes stand as nodes and their interactions are assumed as edges. Here, members of a minimal dominating set could be regarded as master genes. As finitely many minimum dominating sets may exist in a network, it is difficult to identify which one represents the most appropriate set of master genes. In this paper, we develop a weighted gene regulatory network problem with two objectives as a version of the dominating set problem. Collective influence of each gene is considered as its weight. The first objective aims to find a master regulatory genes set with minimum cardinality, and the second objective identifies the one with maximum weight. The model is converted to a single objective using a parameter varying between zero and one. The model is implemented on three human networks, and the results are reported and compared with the existing model of weighted network. Parametric programming in linear optimization and logistic regression are also implemented on the arisen relaxed problem to provide a deeper understanding of the results. Learned from computational results in parametric analysis, for some ranges of priorities in objectives, the identified master regulatory genes are invariant, while some of them are identified for all priorities. This would be an indication that such genes have higher degree of being master regulatory ones, specially on the noisy networks.",,,IEEE/ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform,10.1109/TCBB.2018.2875692,Bakhteh

In the case of the domestic horse, our knowledge of casein genes is limited mainly to coding sequence variants. This study involved screening for polymorphism in 5'-flanking regions of four genes encoding equine caseins (CSN1S1, CSN1S2, CSN2, and CSN3) and making a preliminary assessment of their effect on the gene expression (on the mRNA and protein levels) and milk composition traits in selected horse breeds. Altogether, 23 polymorphisms (21 described previously SNPs and two novel InDels) were found in the studied sequences, the majority of which are common in various horse breeds. Statistical analysis revealed that some are putatively associated with gene expression or milk composition - for example, the c.-2047_-2048insAT polymorphism (CSN1S1) turns out to be related to the total milk protein content in Polish Primitive Horse (p < 0.05), whereas c.-2105C>G SNP (CSN2) is related to beta-casein relative mRNA level and milk lactose concentration in the Polish Coldblood Horse breed (p < 0.05). We have also found significant effects of horse breed and lactation time-point on gene expression and mare's milk composition.

28364035,Distinct Patterns of Gene Gain and Loss: Diverse Evolutionary Modes of NBS-Encoding Genes in Three Solanaceae Crop Species.,"Plant resistance conferred by nucleotide binding site (NBS)-encoding resistance genes plays a key role in the defense against various pathogens throughout the entire plant life cycle. However, comparative analyses for the systematic evaluation and determination of the evolutionary modes of NBS-encoding genes among Solanaceae species are rare. In this study, 447, 255, and 306 NBS-encoding genes were identified from the genomes of potato, tomato, and pepper, respectively. These genes usually clustered as tandem arrays on chromosomes; few existed as singletons. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three subclasses [TNLs (TIR-NBS-LRR), CNLs (CC-NBS-LRR), and RNLs (RPW8-NBS-LRR)] each formed a monophyletic clade and were distinguished by unique exon/intron structures and amino acid motif sequences. By comparing phylogenetic and systematic relationships, we inferred that the NBS-encoding genes in the present genomes of potato, tomato, and pepper were derived from 150 CNL, 22 TNL, and 4 RNL ancestral genes, and underwent independent gene loss and duplication events after speciation. The NBS-encoding genes therefore exhibit diverse and dynamic evolutionary patterns in the three Solanaceae species, giving rise to the discrepant gene numbers observed today. Potato shows a ""consistent expansion"" pattern, tomato exhibits a pattern of ""first expansion and then contraction,"" and pepper presents a ""shrinking"" pattern. The earlier expansion of CNLs in the common ancestor led to the dominance of this subclass in gene numbers. However, RNLs remained at low copy numbers due to their specific functions. Along the evolutionary process of NBS-encoding genes in Solanaceae, species-specific tandem duplications contributed the most to gene expansions.",2018-02-01,"Binding Sites, Evolution, Molecular, Gain of Function Mutation, Genetic Speciation, Loss of Function Mutation, Models, Genetic, Nucleotides, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins, Protein Binding, Solanaceae",G3 (Bethesda),,Qian
29985950,Gene expression profile of a selection of Polycomb Group genes during zebrafish embryonic and germ line development.,"Polycomb Group (PcG) genes are transcriptional repressors that are described to be important during development and differentiation. There is significant interest in PcGs proteins because of their role in stem cell biology and tumorigenesis. In this study we characterize the expression of a selection of PcG genes in the adult germline of zebrafish and during embryogenesis. In adults, expression of selected PcG genes is found to be enriched in germ line over somatic tissues. Therefore, the germ line of adult zebrafish was analyzed for the expression pattern of a selection of PcG genes by whole mount in situ hybridization. We detected presence of the tested PcG gene transcripts at early stages of both oogenesis and spermatogenesis. This enriched expression for early stages of gametogenesis is also observed in developing gonads at 4 and 5 weeks post fertilization. Additionally, zebrafish embryos were used to study the spatio-temporal expression patterns of a selection of PcG genes during development. The PcG genes that we tested are maternally loaded and ubiquitously expressed at early developmental stages, except of ezh1. The expression of the PcG genes that were assessed becomes enriched anteriorly and is more defined during tissue specification. The data shown here is an important resource for functional PcG gene studies in vivo.",2019-01-08,"Animals, Cell Differentiation, Embryo, Nonmammalian, Embryonic Development, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Germ Cells, Polycomb-Group Proteins, Transcriptome, Zebrafish",PLoS One,,Chrispijn
28987343,Comparison of gene co-expression networks in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus reveals conservation in some aspects of virulence.,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus are two evolutionary distant bacterial species that are frequently isolated from persistent infections such as chronic infectious wounds and severe lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients. To the best of our knowledge no comprehensive genome scale co-expression study has been already conducted on these two species and in most cases only the expression of very few genes has been the subject of investigation. In this study, in order to investigate the level of expressional conservation between these two species, using heterogeneous gene expression datasets the weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) approach was applied to study both single and cross species genome scale co-expression patterns of these two species. Single species co-expression network analysis revealed that in P. aeruginosa, genes involved in quorum sensing (QS), iron uptake, nitrate respiration and type III secretion systems and in S. aureus, genes associated with the regulation of carbon metabolism, fatty acid-phospholipids metabolism and proteolysis represent considerable co-expression across a variety of experimental conditions. Moreover, the comparison of gene co-expression networks between P. aeruginosa and S. aureus was led to the identification of four co-expressed gene modules in both species totally consisting of 318 genes. Several genes related to two component signal transduction systems, small colony variants (SCVs) morphotype and protein complexes were found in the detected modules. We believe that targeting the key players among the identified co-expressed orthologous genes will be a potential intervention strategy to control refractory co-infections caused by these two bacterial species.",2017-12-27,"Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Genes, Bacterial, Humans, Pseudomonas Infections, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Quorum Sensing, Staphylococcal Infections, Staphylococcus aureus, Virulence",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.005,Hosseinkhan
29186682,Control of Gene Expression in Senescence through Transcriptional Read-Through of Convergent Protein-Coding Genes.,"Antisense RNAs are non-coding RNAs that can regulate their corresponding sense RNAs and are generally produced from specific promoters. We uncover here a family of antisense RNAs, named START RNAs, produced during cellular senescence by transcriptional read-through at convergent protein-coding genes. Importantly, START RNAs repress the expression of their corresponding sense RNAs. In proliferative cells, we found that the Pol II elongation rate is limited downstream of TTS at START loci, allowing transcription termination to occur before Pol II reaches the convergent genes, thus preventing antisense RNA production and interference with the expression of the convergent genes. START RNAs are repressed by H2A.Z histone variant, whose local occupancy decreases in senescence. Our results thus uncover a mechanism of gene expression regulation relying on read-through antisense transcript production at convergent genes, underlining the functional importance of chromatin regulation in the control of RNA pol II elongation rate at intergenic regions.",2018-07-09,"Cell Line, Cellular Senescence, Chromatin, Computational Biology, Gene Expression Regulation, Humans, Promoter Regions, Genetic, RNA Polymerase II, RNA, Antisense, Transcription, Genetic",Cell Rep,10.1016/j.celrep.2017.11.006,Muniz

27486067,Three alcohol dehydrogenase genes and one acetyl-CoA synthetase gene are responsible for ethanol utilization in Yarrowia lipolytica.,"The non-conventional yeast Yarrowia lipolytica is able to utilize a wide range of different substrates like glucose, glycerol, ethanol, acetate, proteins and various hydrophobic molecules. Although most metabolic pathways for the utilization of these substrates have been clarified by now, it was not clear whether ethanol is oxidized by alcohol dehydrogenases or by an alternative oxidation system inside the cell. In order to detect the genes that are required for ethanol utilization in Y. lipolytica, eight alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) genes and one alcohol oxidase gene (FAO1) have been identified and respective deletion strains were tested for their ability to metabolize ethanol. As a result of this, we found that the availability of ADH1, ADH2 or ADH3 is required for ethanol utilization in Y. lipolytica. A strain with deletions in all three genes is lacking the ability to utilize ethanol as sole carbon source. Although Adh2p showed by far the highest enzyme activity in an in vitro assay, the availability of any of the three genes was sufficient to enable a decent growth. In addition to ADH1, ADH2 and ADH3, an acetyl-CoA synthetase encoding gene (ACS1) was found to be essential for ethanol utilization. As Y. lipolytica is a non-fermenting yeast, it is neither able to grow under anaerobic conditions nor to produce ethanol. To investigate whether Y. lipolytica may produce ethanol, the key genes of alcoholic fermentation in S. cerevisiae, ScADH1 and ScPDC1, were overexpressed in an ADH and an ACS1 deletion strain. However, instead of producing ethanol, the respective strains regained the ability to use ethanol as single carbon source and were still not able to grow under anaerobic conditions.",2017-12-15,"Acetate-CoA Ligase, Aerobiosis, Alcohol Dehydrogenase, Anaerobiosis, DNA, Fungal, Enzyme Activation, Escherichia coli, Ethanol, Fermentation, Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal, Genes, Fungal, Oxidation-Reduction, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Sequence Deletion, Transformation, Genetic, Yarrowia",Fungal Genet Biol,10.1016/j.fgb.2016.07.012,Gatter

26894994,Identification and Validation of Housekeeping Genes for Gene Expression Analysis of Cancer Stem Cells.,"The characterization of cancer stem cell (CSC) subpopulation, through the comparison of the gene expression signature in respect to the native cancer cells, is particularly important for the identification of novel and more effective anticancer strategies. However, CSC have peculiar characteristics in terms of adhesion, growth, and metabolism that possibly implies a different modulation of the expression of the most commonly used housekeeping genes (HKG), like b-actin (ACTB). Although it is crucial to identify which are the most stable HKG genes to normalize the data derived from quantitative Real-Time PCR analysis to obtain robust and consistent results, an exhaustive validation of reference genes in CSC is still missing. Here, we isolated CSC spheres from different musculoskeletal sarcomas and carcinomas as a model to investigate on the stability of the mRNA expression of 15 commonly used HKG, in respect to the native cells. The selected genes were analysed for the variation coefficient and compared using the popular algorithms NormFinder and geNorm to evaluate stability ranking. As a result, we found that: 1) Tata Binding Protein (TBP), Tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein zeta polypeptide (YWHAZ), Peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), and Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) are the most stable HKG for the comparison between CSC and native cells; 2) at least four reference genes should be considered for robust results; 3) the use of ACTB should not be recommended, 4) specific HKG should be considered for studies that are focused only on a specific tumor type, like sarcoma or carcinoma. Our results should be taken in consideration for all the studies of gene expression analysis of CSC, and will substantially contribute for future investigations aimed to identify novel anticancer therapy based on CSC targeting.

29874547,Leveraging multiple gene networks to prioritize GWAS candidate genes via network representation learning.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully discovered a number of disease-associated genetic variants in the past decade, providing an unprecedented opportunity for deciphering genetic basis of human inherited diseases. However, it is still a challenging task to extract biological knowledge from the GWAS data, due to such issues as missing heritability and weak interpretability. Indeed, the fact that the majority of discovered loci fall into noncoding regions without clear links to genes has been preventing the characterization of their functions and appealing for a sophisticated approach to bridge genetic and genomic studies. Towards this problem, network-based prioritization of candidate genes, which performs integrated analysis of gene networks with GWAS data, has emerged as a promising direction and attracted much attention. However, most existing methods overlook the sparse and noisy properties of gene networks and thus may lead to suboptimal performance. Motivated by this understanding, we proposed a novel method called REGENT for integrating multiple gene networks with GWAS data to prioritize candidate genes for complex diseases. We leveraged a technique called the network representation learning to embed a gene network into a compact and robust feature space, and then designed a hierarchical statistical model to integrate features of multiple gene networks with GWAS data for the effective inference of genes associated with a disease of interest. We applied our method to six complex diseases and demonstrated the superior performance of REGENT over existing approaches in recovering known disease-associated genes. We further conducted a pathway analysis and showed that the ability of REGENT to discover disease-associated pathways. We expect to see applications of our method to a broad spectrum of diseases for post-GWAS analysis.

31525603,Identification and 3D gene expression patterns of WUSCEHEL-related homeobox (WOX) genes from Panax ginseng.,"Wild ginseng (Panax ginseng) can survive in their natural habitat for hundreds of years, reflecting a remarkable plasticity. Plant stem cells (SCs) play a key role in the regenerative capacity and lifelong activity of these plants. WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX (WOX) genes are master regulators of plant SC pluripotency, but their functions in medicinal plants have not been previously reported. To investigate whether these genes define different SC niches in ginseng, we cloned and analysed five WOX genes in ginseng (PgWOXs) and found that they might regulate root reconstruction. Then, the whole-mount RNA in situ hybridization was used to characterize the 3D gene expression pattern of PgWOXs in ginseng seedlings and cultured adventitious roots. PgWOX4 was expressed in vascular cambium SCs; PgWOX5 and PgWOX11 were mainly expressed in the tips of seedling and adventitious roots, which are the energetic centre of the meristem; and PgWOX13a and PgWOX13b were detected in the parenchyma cells of the main root of seedlings and cultured adventitious roots, suggesting that they are important for maintaining the balance between SC differentiation and self-renewal in the phloem and xylem. This is the first report of SC regulation in medical herbs; we expect that P. ginseng can serve as a model herb for investigating the relationship between SCs and their herbal morphological features, which would be a new research direction to improve the yield and quality of the medicinal materials by regulating the herbal SCs.",2020-02-03,"Cell Differentiation, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Panax, Plant Proteins",Plant Physiol Biochem,10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.08.027,Liu
26051415,Identification of three IFN-γ inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT)-like genes in mud crab Scylla paramamosain with distinct gene organizations and patterns of expression.,"Vertebrate gamma-interferon inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) is an IFN-γ-inducible protein and is involved in MHCII-restricted antigen processing and cross-presentation of MHCI-restricted antigens in adaptive immunity. Outside of the endocytic MHC pathway, GILT regulates the cellular redox state, inhibits T cell activation, neutralizes extracellular pathogens and is also a host factor of some bacterial pathogens. In this report, we isolated and characterized three divergent GILT-like genes, GILT1, GILT2 and GILT3, which share only 30.9-40.4% identities in a crustacean mud crab Scylla paramamosain. Whilst the crab GILT1 and GILT3 possess four and five exons, respectively, the GILT2 is intronless, suggesting that GILT2 may arise from a recent retroposition event. The invertebrate GILT-like genes have diverse gene organizations and may be evolved in a species/lineage-specific manner as suggested by phylogenetic tree analysis. The amino acid sequences equivalent to human mature GILT are well conserved, including the GILT signature and nine of the ten cysteine residues that potentially form 5 disulfide bonds in human GILT, across the animal kingdom. However, most invertebrate GILT-like molecules lack the human-type N-terminal propeptide, as well as the human-type C-terminal with a conserved cysteine residue, suggesting differences in post translational processing and mode of action. All the three GILT-like genes are highly expressed in the hepatopancreas and up-regulated by pathogenic bacterial infection suggesting a role in immune defense against bacterial diseases.

26909918,Gene expression profiling of epithelial ovarian cancer reveals key genes and pathways associated with chemotherapy resistance.,"The aim of this study is to analyze gene expression data to identify key genes and pathways associated with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and to improve clinical treatment strategies. The gene expression data set was downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus and included 12 chemotherapy-resistant EOC samples and 16 chemotherapy-sensitive EOC samples. A differential analysis was performed to screen out differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A functional enrichment analysis was conducted for the DEGs using the database for annotation, visualization, and integration discovery. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed with information from the human protein reference database. Pathway-pathway interactions were determined with a test based on the hypergeometric distribution. A total of 1564 DEGs were identified in chemotherapy-sensitive EOC, including 654 upregulated genes and 910 downregulated genes. The top three upregulated genes were HIST1H3G, AKT3, and RTN3, while the top three downregulated genes were NBLA00301, TRIM62, and EPHA5. A Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that cell adhesion, biological adhesion, and intracellular signaling cascades were significantly enriched in the DEGs. A KEGG pathway enrichment analysis revealed that the calcium, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and B cell receptor signaling pathways were significantly over-represented in the DEGs. A PPI network containing 101 interactions was acquired. The top three hub genes were RAC1, CAV1, and BCL2. Five modules were identified from the PPI network.

In this paper, we propose a novel integrated approach called IntDriver for prioritizing driver genes. Based on a matrix factorization framework, IntDriver can effectively incorporate functional information from both the interaction network and Gene Ontology similarity, and detect driver genes mutated in different sets of patients at the same time. When evaluated through known benchmarking driver genes, the top ranked genes of our result show highly significant enrichment for the known genes.

Large numbers of genes related to cellular process, metabolism process, response to stimulus, and biological process were expressed during the early and middle stages of embryo development. Fatty acid biosynthesis, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and photosynthesis-related genes were expressed predominantly in embryos at the middle stage. Genes for lipid metabolism and storage proteins were highly expressed in the middle and late stages of embryo development. We also identified 911 transcription factor genes that show differential expression across embryo developmental stages. These results increase our understanding of the complex molecular and cellular events during embryo development in B. rapa and provide a foundation for future studies on other oilseed crops.",2014-12-23,"Brassica rapa, Cluster Analysis, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Gene Ontology, Genes, Plant, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Plant Proteins, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Seeds, Sequence Analysis, RNA",Plant Mol Biol,10.1007/s11103-014-0238-1,Zhang
27992593,Selection and Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Analysis in Vigna angularis Using Quantitative Real-Time RT-PCR.,"Adzuki bean (Vigna angularis) is one of the most important legume crops in Asian countries like China, Japan and Korea due to its nutritious protein and starch contents. In spite of its economic importance, gene expression analysis system for gene function verification of adzuki bean is still absent. Therefore, reference genes for gene expression analysis based on the quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) were screened in current study. A total of nine general housekeeping genes, including ACT, Fbox, ZMPP, GAPDH, EF, PP2A, UBC, UBN and PTB were evaluated for their expression stability by qRT-PCR in four adzuki bean cultivars, three different tissues, four abiotic stress and one biotic stress. The best group of candidates as reference genes were as follows: PTB and ACT for different cultivars; EF and UBN for different tissues; ACT and ZMPP for biotic stress and waterlogging stress; Fbox and UBC for salinity-alkalinity stress; Fbox and PTB for drought stress. Our results will provide a more accurate and reliable normalization of qRT-PCR data in adzuki bean.",2017-07-03,"Crops, Agricultural, Droughts, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Essential, Plant Proteins, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Salinity, Stress, Physiological, Vigna",PLoS One,,Chi
26407966,Integrating ChIP-sequencing and digital gene expression profiling to identify BRD7 downstream genes and construct their regulating network.,"BRD7 is a single bromodomain-containing protein that functions as a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex to regulate transcription. It also interacts with the well-known tumor suppressor protein p53 to trans-activate genes involved in cell cycle arrest. In this paper, we report an integrative analysis of genome-wide chromatin occupancy of BRD7 by chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) and digital gene expression (DGE) profiling by RNA-sequencing upon the overexpression of BRD7 in human cells. We localized 156 BRD7-binding peaks representing 184 genes by ChIP-sequencing, and most of these peaks were co-localized with histone modification sites. Four novel motifs were significantly represented in these BRD7-enriched regions. Ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that 22 of these BRD7 target genes were involved in a network regulating cell death and survival. DGE profiling identified 560 up-regulated genes and 1088 down-regulated genes regulated by BRD7. Using Gene Ontology and pathway analysis, we found significant enrichment of the cell cycle and apoptosis pathway genes. For the integrative analysis of the ChIP-seq and DEG data, we constructed a regulating network of BRD7 downstream genes, and this network suggests multiple feedback regulations of the pathways. Furthermore, we validated BIRC2, BIRC3, TXN2, and NOTCH1 genes as direct, functional BRD7 targets, which were involved in the cell cycle and apoptosis pathways. These results provide a genome-wide view of chromatin occupancy and the gene regulation network of the BRD7 signaling pathway.

31127874,RNA-seq-based selection of reference genes for RT-qPCR analysis of pitaya.,"Reverse-transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) is a primary tool for measuring gene expression levels, and selection of appropriate reference genes is crucial for accurate and reproducible results of gene expression under various experimental conditions. However, no systematic evaluation of reference genes in pitaya (Hylocereus undatus Britt.) has been performed. Here, we examined the expression of five candidate reference genes, namely elongation factor 1-alpha (HuEF1-α), 18S ribosomal RNA (Hu18S rRNA), ubiquitin (HuUBQ), actin (HuACT), and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (HuUQT), under different conditions in pitaya. The expression stabilities of these five genes were evaluated using two computation programs: geNorm and NormFinder. The results were further validated by normalizing the expression of the phosphoglycerate kinase (HuPGK) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor (HuERF) genes. Our results indicate that combined use of HuUBQ and HuUQT is the most stable reference under all of the experimental conditions examined. HuEF1-α, HuUBQ, and HuUQT are the top three most stable reference genes under salt stress, drought stress, and heat stress, and across different cultivars. HuEF1-α, HuACT, and HuUQT exhibited the most stable expression patterns across different tissues.

29697819,Divergence of Noncoding Regulatory Elements Explains Gene-Phenotype Differences between Human and Mouse Orthologous Genes.,"Mice have been widely used as a model organism to investigate human gene-phenotype relationships based on a conjecture that orthologous genes generally perform similar functions and are associated with similar phenotypes. However, phenotypes associated with orthologous genes often turn out to be quite different between human and mouse. Herein, we devised a method to quantitatively compare phenotypes annotations associated with mouse models and human. Using semantic similarity comparisons, we identified orthologous genes with different phenotype annotations, of which the similarity score is on a par with that of random gene pairs. Analysis of sequence evolution and transcriptomic changes revealed that orthologous genes with phenotypic differences are correlated with changes in noncoding regulatory elements and tissue-specific expression profiles rather than changes in protein-coding sequences. To map accurate gene-phenotype relationships using model organisms, we propose that careful consideration of the evolutionary divergence of noncoding regulatory elements and transcriptomic profiles is essential.",2019-06-10,"Animals, Evolution, Molecular, Genetic Techniques, Humans, Mice, Phenotype, Regulatory Elements, Transcriptional, Transcriptome",Mol Biol Evol,10.1093/molbev/msy056,Han
25683375,Clade classification of monolignol biosynthesis gene family members reveals target genes to decrease lignin in Lolium perenne.,"In monocots, lignin content has a strong impact on the digestibility of the cell wall fraction. Engineering lignin biosynthesis requires a profound knowledge of the role of paralogues in the multigene families that constitute the monolignol biosynthesis pathway. We applied a bioinformatics approach for genome-wide identification of candidate genes in Lolium perenne that are likely to be involved in the biosynthesis of monolignols. More specifically, we performed functional subtyping of phylogenetic clades in four multigene families: 4CL, COMT, CAD and CCR. Essential residues were considered for functional clade delineation within these families. This classification was complemented with previously published experimental evidence on gene expression, gene function and enzymatic activity in closely related crops and model species. This allowed us to assign functions to novel identified L. perenne genes, and to assess functional redundancy among paralogues. We found that two 4CL paralogues, two COMT paralogues, three CCR paralogues and one CAD gene are prime targets for genetic studies to engineer developmentally regulated lignin in this species. Based on the delineation of sequence conservation between paralogues and a first analysis of allelic diversity, we discuss possibilities to further study the roles of these paralogues in lignin biosynthesis, including expression analysis, reverse genetics and forward genetics, such as association mapping. We propose criteria to prioritise paralogues within multigene families and certain SNPs within these genes for developing genotyping assays or increasing power in association mapping studies. Although L. perenne was the target of the analyses presented here, this functional subtyping of phylogenetic clades represents a valuable tool for studies investigating monolignol biosynthesis genes in other monocot species.

25686701,Expression of an exogenous 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase gene in psychrotolerant bacteria modulates ethylene metabolism and cold induced genes in tomato under chilling stress.,"The role of stress induced ethylene under low temperature stress has been controversial and hitherto remains unclear. In the present study, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) gene, acdS expressing mutant strains were generated from ACCD negative psychrotolerant bacterial strains Flavobacterium sp. OR306 and Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis OS211, isolated from agricultural soil during late winter. After transformation with plasmid pRKACC which contained the acdS gene, both the strains were able to exhibit ACCD activity in vitro. The effect of this ACCD under chilling stress with regards to ethylene was studied in tomato plants inoculated with both acdS expressing and wild type bacteria. On exposing the plants to one week of chilling treatment at 12/10 °C, it was found that stress ethylene, ACC accumulation and ACO activity which are markers of ethylene stress, were significantly reduced in plants inoculated with the acdS gene transformed mutants. In case of plants inoculated with strain OS211-acdS, ethylene emission, ACC accumulation and ACO activity was significantly reduced by 52%, 75.9% and 23.2% respectively compared to uninoculated control plants. Moreover, expression of cold induced LeCBF1 and LeCBF3 genes showed that these genes were significantly induced by the acdS transformed mutants in addition to reduced expression of ethylene-responsive transcription factor 13 (ETF-13) and ACO genes. Induced expression of LeCBF1 and LeCBF3 in plants inoculated with acdS expressing mutants compared to wild type strains show that physiologically evolved stress ethylene and its transcription factors play a role in regulation of cold induced genes as reported earlier in the literature.",2015-11-30,"Adaptation, Physiological, Amino Acids, Cyclic, Bacteria, Carbon-Carbon Lyases, Cold Temperature, Escherichia coli, Ethylenes, Flavobacterium, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genes, Bacterial, Genes, Plant, Lycopersicon esculentum, Plant Proteins, Pseudomonas, Soil Microbiology, Stress, Physiological, Transcription Factors",Plant Physiol Biochem,10.1016/j.plaphy.2015.02.003,Subramanian

28161916,The Pathway From Genes to Gene Therapy in Glaucoma: A Review of Possibilities for Using Genes as Glaucoma Drugs.,"Treatment of diseases with gene therapy is advancing rapidly. The use of gene therapy has expanded from the original concept of re-placing the mutated gene causing the disease to the use of genes to con-trol nonphysiological levels of expression or to modify pathways known to affect the disease. Genes offer numerous advantages over conventional drugs. They have longer duration of action and are more specific. Genes can be delivered to the target site by naked DNA, cells, nonviral, and viral vectors. The enormous progress of the past decade in molecular bi-ology and delivery systems has provided ways for targeting genes to the intended cell/tissue and safe, long-term vectors. The eye is an ideal organ for gene therapy. It is easily accessible and it is an immune-privileged site. Currently, there are clinical trials for diseases affecting practically every tissue of the eye, including those to restore vision in patients with Leber congenital amaurosis. However, the number of eye trials compared with those for systemic diseases is quite low (1.8%). Nevertheless, judg-ing by the vast amount of ongoing preclinical studies, it is expected that such number will increase considerably in the near future. One area of great need for eye gene therapy is glaucoma, where a long-term gene drug would eliminate daily applications and compliance issues. Here, we review the current state of gene therapy for glaucoma and the possibilities for treating the trabecular meshwork to lower intraocular pressure and the retinal ganglion cells to protect them from neurodegeneration.",2017-03-14,"Clinical Trials as Topic, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Transfer Techniques, Genetic Therapy, Glaucoma, Humans, Neurodegenerative Diseases, Ocular Hypertension, Retinal Degeneration",Asia Pac J Ophthalmol (Phila),,Borrás
29212571,Expression of Homeobox Gene HLX and its Downstream Target Genes are Altered in Placentae From Discordant Twin Pregnancies.,"A discordant twin gestation, in which one fetus is significantly growth restricted, compared to the other normal twin, is a unique model that can be used to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the intrauterine environment affects fetal growth. In many model systems, placental transcription factor genes regulate fetal growth. Transcription factors regulate growth through their activation or repression of downstream target genes that mediate important cell functions. The objective of this study was to determine the expression of the placental HLX homeobox gene transcription factor and its downstream target genes in dizygotic twins with growth discordance. In this cross-sectional study, HLX and its downstream target genes' retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) and cyclin kinase D (CDKN1C) expression levels were determined in placentae obtained from dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancies (n = 23) where one of the twins was growth restricted. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) was defined as small for gestational age with abnormal umbilical artery Doppler indices when compared with the normal control co-twin. Homeobox gene HLX expression was significantly decreased at both the mRNA and protein levels in FGR twin placentae compared with the normal control co-twin placentae (p < .05). Downstream target genes CDKN1C and RB1 were also significantly decreased and increased, respectively, at both the mRNA and protein levels in FGR twin placentae compared with normal control co-twin placentae (p < .05). Together, these observations suggest an important association between HLX transcription factor expression and abnormal human placental development in discordant twin pregnancies.",2018-11-07,"Birth Weight, Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p57, Female, Fetal Growth Retardation, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Homeodomain Proteins, Humans, Immunohistochemistry, Placenta, Pregnancy, Pregnancy, Twin, Retinoblastoma Binding Proteins, Transcription Factors, Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",Twin Res Hum Genet,10.1017/thg.2017.66,Yuen
30097214,Bioinformatics analysis of gene expression profiles to diagnose crucial and novel genes in glioblastoma multiform.,"Therefore, the current study aimed to diagnose the genes associated in the pathogenesis of GBM. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were diagnosed using the limma software package. The ToppFun was used to perform pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the DEGs. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, extracted modules, miRNA-target genes regulatory network and miRNA-target genes regulatory network were used to obtain insight into the actions of DEGs. Survival analysis for DEGs carried out. A total of 701 DEGs, including 413 upregulated and 288 downregulated genes, were diagnosed between U1118MG cell line (PK 11195 treated with 1 h exposure) and U1118MG cell line (PK 11195 treated with 24 h exposure). The up-regulated genes were enriched in superpathway of pyrimidine deoxyribonucleotides de novo biosynthesis, cell cycle, cell cycle process and chromosome. The down-regulated genes were enriched in folate transformations I, biosynthesis of amino acids, cellular amino acid metabolic process and vacuolar membrane. The current study screened the genes in PPI network, extracted modules, miRNA-target genes regulatory network and miRNA-target genes regulatory network with higher degrees as hub genes, which included MYC, TERF2IP, CDK1, EEF1G, TXNIP, SLC1A5, RGS4 and IER5L Survival suggested that low expressed NR4A2, SLC7 A5, CYR61 and ID1 in patients with GBM was linked with a positive prognosis for overall survival. In conclusion, the current study could improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms in the progression of GBM, and these crucial as well as new molecular markers might be used as therapeutic targets for GBM.",2018-11-16,"Brain Neoplasms, Computational Biology, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Glioblastoma, Humans, Kaplan-Meier Estimate, Proportional Hazards Models, Transcriptome",Pathol Res Pract,10.1016/j.prp.2018.07.015,Vastrad
32444679,Over-expression of transcription factor ARK1 gene leads to down-regulation of lignin synthesis related genes in hybrid poplar '717'.,"Improving wood growth rate and wood quality are worthy goals in forest genetics and breeding research. The ARK1 gene is one member of the ARBORKNOX family in all plants, which play an essential role in the process of plant growth and development, but the mechanism associated with its gene network regulation is poorly investigated. In order to generate over-expression transgenic hybrid poplar, the agrobacterium-mediated transformation was used to obtain transgenic hybrid poplar '717' plants to provide insight into the function of the ARK1 gene in poplar. Moreover, the morphology of transgenic plants was observed, and transcriptome analysis was performed to explore the ARK1 gene function. The results showed that there were significant differences in pitch, stem diameter, petiole length, leaf width, leaf length and seedling height between ARK1 transgenic seedlings and non-transgenic seedlings. The transgenic seedlings usually had multiple branches and slender leaves, with some leaves not being fully developed. The results of transcriptome analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes were involved in the growth of poplars, including proteins, transcription factors and protein kinases. Genes related to the positive regulation in plant hormone signal transduction pathways were up-regulated, and the genes related to lignin synthesis were down-regulated. The RT-qPCR analysis confirmed the expression levels of the genes involved in the plant hormone signal transduction pathways and phenylpropanoid pathway. In conclusion, the ARK1 gene had a positive regulatory effect on plant growth, and the gene's coding enzymes related to lignin synthesis were down-regulated.",,,Sci Rep,,Ye

The result is a set of biclusters, each forming a specific submatrix of rows (e.g. genes) and columns (e.g. samples). Relevant biclusters can, however, be missed when, due to the presence of a few outliers, they lack the assumed homogeneity of expression values among a few gene/sample combinations.

29571614,Coupling the roles of Hox genes to regulatory networks patterning cranial neural crest.,"The neural crest is a transient population of cells that forms within the developing central nervous system and migrates away to generate a wide range of derivatives throughout the body during vertebrate embryogenesis. These cells are of evolutionary and clinical interest, constituting a key defining trait in the evolution of vertebrates and alterations in their development are implicated in a high proportion of birth defects and craniofacial abnormalities. In the hindbrain and the adjacent cranial neural crest cells (cNCCs), nested domains of Hox gene expression provide a combinatorial'Hox-code' for specifying regional properties in the developing head. Hox genes have been shown to play important roles at multiple stages in cNCC development, including specification, migration, and differentiation. However, relatively little is known about the underlying gene-regulatory mechanisms involved, both upstream and downstream of Hox genes. Furthermore, it is still an open question as to how the genes of the neural crest GRN are linked to Hox-dependent pathways. In this review, we describe Hox gene expression, function and regulation in cNCCs with a view to integrating these genes within the emerging gene regulatory network for cNCC development. We highlight early roles for Hox1 genes in cNCC specification, proposing that this may be achieved, in part, by regulation of the balance between pluripotency and differentiation in precursor cells within the neuro-epithelium. We then describe what is known about the regulation of Hox gene expression in cNCCs and discuss this from the perspective of early vertebrate evolution.",2019-06-14,"Animals, Biological Evolution, Body Patterning, Cell Differentiation, Cell Movement, Central Nervous System, Conserved Sequence, Cranial Nerves, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Homeobox, Head, Humans, Neural Crest, Neural Tube, Neurons, Rhombencephalon, Skull, Vertebrates",Dev Biol,10.1016/j.ydbio.2018.03.016,Parker

28720013,The 5-HT1B serotonin receptor regulates methylphenidate-induced gene expression in the striatum: Differential effects on immediate-early genes.,"Drug combinations that include a psychostimulant such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor such as fluoxetine are indicated in several medical conditions. Co-exposure to these drugs also occurs with ""cognitive enhancer"" use by individuals treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Methylphenidate, a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, by itself produces some addiction-related gene regulation in the striatum. We have demonstrated that co-administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors potentiates these methylphenidate-induced molecular effects, thus producing a more ""cocaine-like"" profile. There is evidence that the 5-HT1B serotonin receptor subtype mediates some of the cocaine-induced gene regulation. We thus investigated whether the 5-HT1B receptor also modifies methylphenidate-induced gene regulation, by assessing effects of a selective 5-HT1B receptor agonist (CP94253) on immediate-early gene markers ( Zif268, c- Fos, Homer1a) in adolescent male rats. Gene expression was measured by in situ hybridization histochemistry. Our results show that CP94253 (3, 10 mg/kg) produced a dose-dependent potentiation of methylphenidate (5 mg/kg)-induced expression of Zif268 and c- Fos. This potentiation was widespread in the striatum and was maximal in lateral (sensorimotor) sectors, thus mimicking the effects seen after cocaine alone, or co-administration of fluoxetine. However, in contrast to fluoxetine, this 5-HT1B agonist did not influence methylphenidate-induced expression of Homer1a. CP94253 also potentiated methylphenidate-induced locomotor activity. These findings indicate that stimulation of the 5-HT1B receptor can enhance methylphenidate (dopamine)-induced gene regulation. This receptor may thus participate in the potentiation induced by fluoxetine (serotonin) and may serve as a pharmacological target to attenuate methylphenidate + selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced ""cocaine-like"" effects.",2018-04-20,"Animals, Corpus Striatum, Dose-Response Relationship, Drug, Drug Synergism, Early Growth Response Protein 1, Fluoxetine, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Immediate-Early, Homer Scaffolding Proteins, Locomotion, Male, Methylphenidate, Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos, Pyridines, Rats, Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1B, Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists",J Psychopharmacol,,Alter

29631007,Novel miRNA genes deregulated by aberrant methylation in ovarian carcinoma are involved in metastasis.,"Methylation of promoter CpG islands may suppress the function of miRNAs by inhibiting their expression. Our work analyzes the role of promoter methylation in altering the expression of 12 miRNAs associated with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC): miR-124-3p, -125b-5p, -127-5p, -129-5p, -132-3p, -137, -148a-3p, -191-5p, -193a-5p, -203a, -339-3p, and -375. The role of methylation in the deregulation of these miRNAs has not been previously assessed in a representative set of EOC samples. Using 76 paired (tumor/matched normal) ovarian samples and methylation-specific PCR, we demonstrated significant aberrations in the methylation patterns of 11 miRNA genes and identified 8 novel hypermethylated miRNA genes (MIR-124-1, -124-2, -124-3, -127, -132, -137, -193A, and -339) as well as one hypomethylated miRNA gene (MIR-191). Quantitative PCR on a subset of 29 paired EOC samples allowed us to establish a strong correlation between methylation status and alterations in expression levels for all 12 miRNAs studied. These findings demonstrate the functional role of aberrant methylation of examined miRNA genes in EOC. Moreover, we showed a significant association of hypermethylation of 10 miRNA genes (MIR-124-2, -124-3, -125B-1, -127, -129-2, -137, -193A, -203A, -339, -375) with EOC metastasis to lymph nodes, peritoneum, and distant organs. Interestingly, MIR-203A and MIR-375 were hypermethylated only in disseminated ovarian tumors, implying that non-suppressor miR-203a and miR-375 have anti-metastatic properties.

However, its implications for unsupervised data mining using molecular data is under-explored. We found that embedding can extract biologically relevant information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene expression dataset by learning a vector representation through gene co-occurrence. Ground truth relationship, such as cancer types of the input sample and semantic meaning of genes, were showed to retain in the resulting entity matrices. We also demonstrated the interpretability and usage of these matrices in shortlisting candidates from a long gene list as in the case of immunotherapy response. 73 related genes are singled out while the relatedness of 55 genes with immune checkpoint proteins (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) are supported by literature. 16 novel genes (",,,Front Genet,,Choy
23974931,Validation of housekeeping genes for studying differential gene expression in the bovine myometrium.,"The aim of this study was to determine the steady-state expression of 13 selected housekeeping genes in the myometrium of cyclic and pregnant cows. Cells taken from bovine myometrium on days 1-5, 6-10, 11-16 and 17-20 of the oestrous cycle and in weeks 3-5, 6-8 and 9-12 of pregnancy were used. Reverse transcribed RNA was amplified in real-time PCR using designed primers. Reaction efficiency was determined with the Linreg programme. The geNorm and NormFinder programmes were used to select the best housekeeping genes. They calculate the expression stability factor for each used housekeeping gene with the smallest value for most stably expressed genes. According to geNorm, the most stable housekeeping genes in the myometrium were C2orf29, TPB and TUBB2B, while the least stably expressed genes were 18S RNA, HPRT1 and GAPDH. NormFinder identified the best genes in the myometrium as C2orf29, MRPL12 and TBP, while the worst genes were 18S RNA, B2M and SF3A1. Differences in stability factors between the two programmes may also indicate that the physiological status of the female, e.g. pregnancy, affects the stability of expression of housekeeping genes. The different expression stability of housekeeping genes did not affect progesterone receptor expression but it could be important if small differences in gene expression were measured between studies.

Currently, no reference genes have been described for evaluating gene expression in Brevipalpus yothersi, the false spider mite, a polyphagous that act as vector of the citrus leprosis virus C (CiLV-C), an important citrus disease. This study aimed to identify the most stable reference genes in B. yothersi. The RT-qPCR expression data for selected genes were evaluated from three conditions: different developmental stages, plant hosts and acquisition of CiLV-C. To analyze the stability of the candidate reference genes we used ΔCq method, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper and RefFinder. Ubiq and GAPDH are best suited for normalizing gene expression data in viruliferous and non-viruliferous mites. Ubiq, EF1α and GAPDH are the most stable for different developmental stages. RPL13 and RPL32 are the best reference genes for approaches to B. yothersi in different host plants. Considering all the experimental conditions, Ubiq, EF1α, and GAPDH were the most stable genes. Here we developed an accurate and comprehensive RT-qPCR strategy for use in B. yothersi gene expression analysis.

25315323,Nonsyntenic genes drive highly dynamic complementation of gene expression in maize hybrids.,"Maize (Zea mays) displays an exceptional level of structural genomic diversity, which is likely unique among higher eukaryotes. In this study, we surveyed how the genetic divergence of two maize inbred lines affects the transcriptomic landscape in four different primary root tissues of their F1-hybrid progeny. An extreme instance of complementation was frequently observed: genes that were expressed in only one parent but in both reciprocal hybrids. This single-parent expression (SPE) pattern was detected for 2341 genes with up to 1287 SPE patterns per tissue. As a consequence, the number of active genes in hybrids exceeded that of their parents in each tissue by >400. SPE patterns are highly dynamic, as illustrated by their excessive degree of tissue specificity (80%). The biological significance of this type of complementation is underpinned by the observation that a disproportionally high number of SPE genes (75 to 82%) is nonsyntenic, as opposed to all expressed genes (36%). These genes likely evolved after the last whole-genome duplication and are therefore younger than the syntenic genes. In summary, SPE genes shape the remarkable gene expression plasticity between root tissues and complementation in maize hybrids, resulting in a tissue-specific increase of active genes in F1-hybrids compared with their inbred parents.

32180586,Identification of Hub Genes in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer Using Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis.,"BACKGROUND High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) is the most malignant gynecologic tumor. This study reveals biomarkers related to HGSOC incidence and progression using the bioinformatics method. MATERIAL AND METHODS Five gene expression profiles were downloaded from GEO. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in HGSOC and normal ovarian tissue samples were screened using limma and the function of DEGs was annotated by KEGG and GO analysis using clusterProfiler. A co-expression network utilizing the WGCNA package was established to define several hub genes from the key module. Furthermore, survival analysis was performed, followed by expression validation with datasets from TCGA and GTEx. Finally, we used single-gene GSEA to detect the function of prognostic hub genes. RESULTS Out of the 1874 DEGs detected from 114 HGSOC versus 49 normal tissue samples, 956 were upregulated and 919 were downregulated. The functional annotation indicated that upregulated DEGs were mostly enriched in cell cycle, whereas the downregulated DEGs were enriched in the MAPK or Ras signaling pathway. Two modules significantly associated with HGSOC were excavated through WGCNA. After survival analysis and expression validation of hub genes, we found that 2 upregulated genes (MAD2L1 and PKD2) and 3 downregulated genes (DOCK5, FANCD2 and TBRG1) were positively correlated with HGSOC prognosis. GSEA for single-hub genes revealed that MAD2L1 and PKD2 were associated with proliferation, while DOCK5, FANCD2, and TBRG1 were associated with immune response. CONCLUSIONS We found that FANCD2, PKD2, TBRG1, and DOCK5 had prognostic value and could be used as potential biomarkers for HGSOC treatment.",,,Med Sci Monit,,Wu

Adaptability and flowering time are important agronomic characteristics that influence the quality and yield of watermelon, however, the molecular basis underlying these traits were still unclear. In this study, we identified 166, 182, 178, and 279 flowering genes in watermelon, melon, cucumber and pumpkin, respectively, and found that a lot of genes in the photoperiodic, autonomous, and vernalization pathways were absence in the four cucurbits. A higher ratio of flowering time genes was identified in the hormone pathway in cucurbits than in Arabidopsis, and a higher average ka/ks value of hormone pathway genes than the photoperiodic and vernalization pathway genes was identified in watermelon. Moreover, a gene ClGA2/KS (Cla005482) were found to associated with ecotype differentiation, flowering time, and whole growth period in watermelon. This study added knowledge to the molecular basis of flowering time regulation in cucurbits, and the molecule marker of ClGA2/KS gene may facilitate the breeding progress for selecting watermelon varieties with superior adaption and flowering time.",2020-06-23,"Acclimatization, Citrullus, Cucurbitaceae, Flowers, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Genome-Wide Association Study, Phylogeny, Transcriptome",Mol Biol Rep,,Yi
28041944,Large-scale identification of differentially expressed genes during pupa development reveals solute carrier gene is essential for pupal pigmentation in Chilo suppressalis.,"Insects undergo metamorphosis, involving an abrupt change in body structure through cell growth and differentiation. Rice stem stripped borer (SSB), Chilo suppressalis, is one of the most destructive rice pests. However, little is known about the regulation mechanism of metamorphosis development in this notorious insect pest. Here, we studied the expression of 22,197 SSB genes at seven time points during pupa development with a customized microarray, identifying 622 differentially expressed genes (DEG) during pupa development. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these DEGs indicated that the genes related to substance metabolism were highly expressed in the early pupa, which participate in the physiological processes of larval tissue disintegration at these stages. In comparison, highly expressed genes in the late pupal stages were mainly associated with substance biosynthesis, consistent with adult organ formation at these stages. There were 27 solute carrier (SLC) genes that were highly expressed during pupa development. We knocked down SLC22A3 at the prepupal stage, demonstrating that silencing SLC22A3 induced a deficiency in pupa stiffness and pigmentation. The RNAi-treated individuals had white and soft pupa, suggesting that this gene has an essential role in pupal development.",2017-07-14,"Animals, Gene Expression, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Insect Proteins, Metamorphosis, Biological, Moths, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Pigmentation, Pupa",J Insect Physiol,10.1016/j.jinsphys.2016.12.007,Sun
28055303,Gene length as a biological timer to establish temporal transcriptional regulation.,"Transcriptional timing is inherently influenced by gene length, thus providing a mechanism for temporal regulation of gene expression. While gene size has been shown to be important for the expression timing of specific genes during early development, whether it plays a role in the timing of other global gene expression programs has not been extensively explored. Here, we investigate the role of gene length during the early transcriptional response of human fibroblasts to serum stimulation. Using the nascent sequencing techniques Bru-seq and BruUV-seq, we identified immediate genome-wide transcriptional changes following serum stimulation that were linked to rapid activation of enhancer elements. We identified 873 significantly induced and 209 significantly repressed genes. Variations in gene size allowed for a large group of genes to be simultaneously activated but produce full-length RNAs at different times. The median length of the group of serum-induced genes was significantly larger than the median length of all expressed genes, housekeeping genes, and serum-repressed genes. These gene length relationships were also observed in corresponding mouse orthologs, suggesting that relative gene size is evolutionarily conserved. The sizes of transcription factor and microRNA genes immediately induced after serum stimulation varied dramatically, setting up a cascade mechanism for temporal expression arising from a single activation event. The retention and expansion of large intronic sequences during evolution have likely played important roles in fine-tuning the temporal expression of target genes in various cellular response programs.",2017-06-05,"Animals, Conserved Sequence, Enhancer Elements, Genetic, Evolution, Molecular, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Humans, Male, Mice, MicroRNAs, Models, Biological, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Serum, Serum Response Factor, Time Factors, Transcription Factors, Transcription, Genetic, Uridine",Cell Cycle,,Kirkconnell

24699800,Identification of differentially expressed genes involved in transient regeneration of the neonatal C57BL/6J mouse heart by digital gene expression profiling.,"Accumulating evidence has revealed that the mammalian heart possesses a measurable capacity for renewal. Neonatal mice retain a regenerative capacity over a short time-frame (≤6 days), but this capacity is lost by 7 days of age. In the present study, differential gene expression profiling of mouse cardiac tissue was performed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying this process. The global gene expression patterns of the neonatal C57BL/6J mouse heart were examined at three key time-points (1, 6 and 7 days old) using digital gene expression analysis. In the distribution of total clean tags, high-expression tags (>100 copies) were found to be predominant, whereas low expression tags (<5 copies) occupied the majority of distinct tag distributions. In total, 306 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in cardiac tissue, with the expression levels of 115 genes upregulated and those of 191 genes downregulated in 7-day-old mice compared with expression levels in 1- and 6-day-old mice, respectively. The expression levels of five DEGs were confirmed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology analysis revealed a large proportion of DEGs distributed throughout the cell, and these DEGs were associated with binding as well as catalytic, hydrolase, transferase and molecular transducer activities. Furthermore, these genes were involved in cellular, metabolic and developmental processes, as well as biological regulation and signaling pathways. Pathway analysis identified the oxidative phosphorylation pathway to be the process most significantly putatively affected by the differential expression of these genes. These data provide the basis for future analysis of the gene expression patterns that regulate the molecular mechanism of cardiac regeneration.",2015-01-05,"Animals, Animals, Newborn, Expressed Sequence Tags, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Gene Regulatory Networks, Heart, Male, Mice, Mice, Inbred C57BL, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Regeneration, Reproducibility of Results",Mol Med Rep,,Liu

29470858,Genes affecting progression of bacteriophage P22 infection in Salmonella identified by transposon and single gene deletion screens.,"Bacteriophages rely on their hosts for replication, and many host genes critically determine either viral progeny production or host success via phage resistance. A random insertion transposon library of 240,000 mutants in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium was used to monitor effects of individual bacterial gene disruptions on bacteriophage P22 lytic infection. These experiments revealed candidate host genes that alter the timing of phage P22 propagation. Using a False Discovery Rate of < 0.1, mutations in 235 host genes either blocked or delayed progression of P22 lytic infection, including many genes for which this role was previously unknown. Mutations in 77 genes reduced the survival time of host DNA after infection, including mutations in genes for enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) synthesis and osmoregulated periplasmic glucan (OPG). We also screened over 2000 Salmonella single gene deletion mutants to identify genes that impacted either plaque formation or culture growth rates. The gene encoding the periplasmic membrane protein YajC was newly found to be essential for P22 infection. Targeted mutagenesis of yajC shows that an essentially full-length protein is required for function, and potassium efflux measurements demonstrated that YajC is critical for phage DNA ejection across the cytoplasmic membrane.",2019-01-29,"Bacteriophage P22, DNA Transposable Elements, Gene Deletion, Genetic Testing, Lysogeny, Mutation, Salmonella, Salmonella Phages, Salmonella typhimurium, Transduction, Genetic",Mol Microbiol,,Bohm
27005618,Transcriptome and Gene Ontology (GO) Enrichment Analysis Reveals Genes Involved in Biotin Metabolism That Affect L-Lysine Production in Corynebacterium glutamicum.,"Corynebacterium glutamicum is widely used for amino acid production. In the present study, 543 genes showed a significant change in their mRNA expression levels in L-lysine-producing C. glutamicum ATCC21300 than that in the wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC13032. Among these 543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 28 genes were up- or downregulated. In addition, 454 DEGs were functionally enriched and categorized based on BLAST sequence homologies and gene ontology (GO) annotations using the Blast2GO software. Interestingly, NCgl0071 (bioB, encoding biotin synthase) was expressed at levels ~20-fold higher in the L-lysine-producing ATCC21300 strain than that in the wild-type ATCC13032 strain. Five other genes involved in biotin metabolism or transport--NCgl2515 (bioA, encoding adenosylmethionine-8-amino-7-oxononanoate aminotransferase), NCgl2516 (bioD, encoding dithiobiotin synthetase), NCgl1883, NCgl1884, and NCgl1885--were also expressed at significantly higher levels in the L-lysine-producing ATCC21300 strain than that in the wild-type ATCC13032 strain, which we determined using both next-generation RNA sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analysis. When we disrupted the bioB gene in C. glutamicum ATCC21300, L-lysine production decreased by approximately 76%, and the three genes involved in biotin transport (NCgl1883, NCgl1884, and NCgl1885) were significantly downregulated.

30664180,Weighted gene co‑expression network analysis for identifying hub genes in association with prognosis in Wilms tumor.,"Wilms tumor (WT) is the most common type of renal malignancy in children. Survival rates are low and high‑risk WT generally still carries a poor prognosis. To better elucidate the pathogenesis and tumorigenic pathways of high‑risk WT, the present study presents an integrated analysis of RNA expression profiles of high‑risk WT to identify predictive molecular biomarkers, for the improvement of therapeutic decision‑making. mRNA sequence data from high‑risk WT and adjacent normal samples were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R software. From 132 Wilms tumor samples and six normal samples, 2,089 downregulated and 941 upregulated DEGs were identified. In order to identify hub DEGs that regulate target genes, weighted gene co‑expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to identify 11 free‑scale gene co‑expressed clusters. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were annotated using KEGG Orthology Based Annotation System annotation of different module genes. The Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes was used to construct a protein‑protein interaction network for the identified DEGs, and the hub genes of WGCNA modules were identified using the Cytohubb plugin with Cytoscape software. Survival analysis was subsequently performed to highlight hub genes with a clinical signature. The present results suggest that epidermal growth factor, cyclin dependent kinase 1, endothelin receptor type A, nerve growth factor receptor, opa‑interacting protein 5, NDC80 kinetochore complex component and cell division cycle associated 8 are essential to high‑risk WT pathogenesis, and they are closely associated with clinical prognosis.",2019-05-24,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Computational Biology, Databases, Genetic, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Humans, Kidney Neoplasms, Molecular Sequence Annotation, Neoplasm Proteins, Prognosis, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps, Software, Transcriptome, Wilms Tumor",Mol Med Rep,,Wang
31978510,Targeting LA7 breast cancer stem cells of rat through repressing the genes of stemness-related transcription factors using three different biological fluids.,"Down-regulation of stemness genes expression is important in differentiation therapy against cancer stem cells (CSCs). The aim of this study was to evaluate the Oct4 , Sox2, Nanog, and C-myc expression in rat breast cancer stem cells (LA7) which treated with human ovarian follicular fluid (FF), replicative senescent fibroblast culture supernatant (P14), and 16 h serum starved fibroblast supernatant (16 h-SFS). The cells were exposed to these biological fluids for 24 h, 72 h, and 7 days. Stem-loop RT-qPCR assay was used to quantify the expression of above mentioned genes. Results showed that FF had the least cytotoxic effect on the LA7 cells. Except for Nanog gene, exposure of LA7 cell line to 16 h-SFS and P14 decreased significantly expression of the three other genes after 24 h (P < 0.05). Nanog and Sox2 genes expression was also decreased in LA7 cells which have been already treated with FF for 24 h. Moreover, compared to the control solution, the expression of Oct4 increased significantly after 7 days exposure to FF (P < 0.05). Annexin V-PE /7-AAD-, acridine orange/ethidium bromide staining and doubling time assays revealed apoptosis and necrosis induction by these biological fluids in LA7 cells. Moreover, in an in vitro model of metastasis assay, i.e., scratch test, these fluids exhibited anti-LA7 migration activity which culminated in 16 h-SFS treated cells. Generally, this study showed that FF, 16 h-SFS, and P14 have positive effects on down-regulation of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and C-myc expression, and consequently can increase the differentiation of breast cancer stem cells.

Because of the intrinsic difficulties in genome manipulation in this fungus, most studies have been focused on gene expression analysis using quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). qPCR is a powerful technique but its reliability resides in the correct selection of a set of reference genes used in the data normalization. In this study, we determined the expression stability of 11 selected reference genes in H. annosum. Almost nothing has so far been published about validation of a set of reference genes to be used in gene expression experiments in this fungus. Eleven reference genes were validated in H. annosum which was grown on three different substrates: pine bark, pine heartwood, and pine sapwood. Bestkeeper and NormFinder Excel-based software were used to evaluate the reference gene transcripts' stability. The results from these two programs indicated that three reference genes namely Tryp metab, RNA Pol3 TF, and Actin were stable in H. annosum in the conditions studied. Interestingly, the GAPDH transcript which has been extensively used in qPCR data normalization is not the best choice when a wide reference gene selection is available.

27840988,"Selection of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies in normal human ovarian tissues, borderline ovarian tumours and ovarian cancer.","The use of reference genes is the most common method of controlling the variation in mRNA expression during quantitative polymerase chain reaction, although the use of traditional reference genes, such as β‑actin, glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase or 18S ribosomal RNA, without validation occasionally leads to unreliable results. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate a set of five commonly used reference genes to determine the most suitable for gene expression studies in normal ovarian tissues, borderline ovarian and ovarian cancer tissues. The expression stabilities of these genes were ranked using two gene stability algorithms, geNorm and NormFinder. Using geNorm, the two best reference genes in ovarian cancer were β‑glucuronidase and β‑actin. Hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 and β‑glucuronidase were the most stable in ovarian borderline tumours, and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 and glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase were the most stable in normal ovarian tissues. NormFinder ranked β‑actin the most stable in ovarian cancer, and the best combination of two genes was β‑glucuronidase and β‑actin. In borderline tumours, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 was identified as the most stable, and the best combination was hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 and β‑glucuronidase. In normal ovarian tissues, β‑glucuronidase was recommended as the optimum reference gene, and the most optimum pair of reference genes was hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 and β‑actin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the selection of a set of reference genes for normalisation in quantitative polymerase chain reactions in different ovarian tissues, and therefore it is recommended that β‑glucuronidase, β‑actin and hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase‑1 are the most suitable reference genes for such analyses.",2017-04-06,"Computational Biology, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Humans, Neoplasm Grading, Ovarian Neoplasms, Ovary, Precancerous Conditions, Transcriptome",Mol Med Rep,10.3892/mmr.2016.5933,Ofinran

The genes for the enzymes chlorate reductase (clrABDC) and chlorite dismutase, necessary for chlorate metabolism and probably acquired by lateral gene transfer, are located in a gene cluster that also includes other genes potentially important for chlorate metabolism. Among those are a gene for cytochrome c (cyc) whose gene product may serve as an electron carrier during chlorate reduction, a cofactor biosynthesis gene (mobB) and a predicted transcriptional regulator (arsR). Only chlorate reductase and chlorite dismutase have been shown to be expressed in vivo. Here, we report the in vivo production of a single polycistronic transcript covering eight open reading frames including clrABDC, cyc, mobB and arsR. Transcription levels of the cyc and clrA genes were compared to each other by the use of qRT-PCR in RNA preparations from cells grown under aerobic or chlorate reducing anaerobic conditions. The two genes showed the same mRNA levels under both growth regimes, indicating that no transcription termination occurs between them. Higher transcription levels were observed at growth without external oxygen supply. Implications for electron pathway integration following lateral gene transfer are discussed.

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was also performed to examine and identify the genes correlated to PAs, to identify candidate therapeutic targets for the treatment of PAs. The DNA methylation profile and gene expression profile were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Following screening of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially methylated regions (DMRs), respectively, integrated analysis of the DEGs and DMRs was performed to detect their correlation. Subsequently, the WGCNA algorithm was applied to identify the significant modules and construct the co‑expression network associated with PAs. Furthermore, Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of the associated genes was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. A total number of 2,259 DEGs and 235 DMRs were screened out. Integrated analysis revealed that 30 DEGs were DMRs with prominent negative correlation (cor=‑0.82; P=0.02). Based on the DEGs, the gene co‑expression network was constructed, and nine network modules associated with PAs were identified. The functional analysis results showed that genes relevant to PAs were closely associated with cell differentiation modulation. The screened PA-associated genes were significantly different at the expression and methylation levels. These genes may be used as reliable candidate target genes for the treatment of PAs.",2016-12-28,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Astrocytoma, Child, Child, Preschool, Cluster Analysis, DNA Methylation, Databases, Genetic, Female, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Infant, Infant, Newborn, Male, Middle Aged, Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis, Transcriptome, Young Adult",Mol Med Rep,,Zhou
29642183,Identification of genes related to consecutive trauma-induced sepsis via gene expression profiling analysis.,"We aimed to identify crucial genes relevant to the development of consecutive trauma-induced sepsis.A microarray dataset was used to identify genes differentially expressed between peripheral blood samples from consecutive traumatized patients complicated with sepsis and not complicated with sepsis. The dataset GSE12624 was obtained from Gene Expression Omnibus, containing 34 peripheral blood samples from consecutive traumatized patients complicated by sepsis and 36 consecutive traumatized controls. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using Linear Models for Microarray Data package. Then, gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis for DEGs was performed by Onto-Express. Subsequently, the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed and pathway enrichment analysis was performed by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). Furthermore, protein complexes in the PPI network were predicted by ClusterONE and validated through GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses, and protein domain analysis.Totally, 446 upregulated and 447 downregulated DEGs were identified. Some DEGs were related to acyl-CoA binding (eg, ACBD6), chromosome, and centromeric region (eg, CENPN). In the PPI network, some DEGs were enriched in renin-angiotensin system (RAS, eg, AGTR1 and AGTR2). Three predicted protein complexes were validated in the PPI network. Some genes composing protein complex A were associated with cell proliferation (eg, CDC20, CCNB1, MCM4, RPA2, and PRIM2), and several genes composing protein complex F were implicated in regulation of actin cytoskeleton (eg, PFN2, ARPC2, and WASL).The results suggest that those DEGs may be crucial in the etiology of consecutive trauma-induced sepsis, and they are expected to be therapeutic targets.",2018-04-23,"ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters, Cdc20 Proteins, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Microarray Analysis, Profilins, Protein Binding, Protein Interaction Mapping, Protein Interaction Maps, Receptor, Angiotensin, Type 1, Reproducibility of Results, Sepsis, Up-Regulation, Wounds and Injuries",Medicine (Baltimore),,Dong
32161782,Identification of stable reference genes for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophage gene expression studies.,"Gene expression studies which utilize lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages to model immune signaling are widely used for elucidating the mechanisms of inflammation-related disease. When expression levels of target genes are quantified using Real-Time quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), they are analyzed in comparison to reference genes, which should have stable expression. Judicious selection of reference genes is, therefore, critical to interpretation of qRT-PCR results. Ideal reference genes must be identified for each experimental system and demonstrated to remain constant under the experimental conditions. In this study, we evaluated the stability of eight common reference genes: Beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), Cyclophilin A/Peptidylprolyl isomerase A, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphatedehydrogenase (GAPDH), Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase 1, Large Ribosomal Protein P0, TATA box binding protein, Ubiquitin C (UBC), and Ribosomal protein L13A.

In the present study, expression analysis of six different constitutively expressed genes viz. 18S ribosomal RNA, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), beta actin (βactin), ribosomal binding protein L13, tubulin and TATA-box-binding protein (tbp) were carried out to test their efficacy as reference genes in three different tissues, namely liver, gill and muscle of murrel Channa striatus exposed to high temperature for variable time periods. The stability and suitability of the genes were determined by using bioinformatic tools: GeNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. Based on the results, tub/βactin could be used as the reference genes for liver and gill tissues and βactin/gapdh could be the reference genes for muscle tissues in Channa striatus under both short- and long-term thermal stress.

25573171,Identification of suitable reference genes for gene expression studies using quantitative polymerase chain reaction in lung cancer in vitro.,"The present study aimed to examine 10 housekeeping genes (HKGs), including 18s ribosomal RNA (18S), glyceraldehyde‑3‑phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), ribosomal protein large P0 (RPLP0), β‑actin (ACTB), peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), phosphoglycerate kinase‑1 (PGK1), β‑2‑microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal protein LI3a (RPL13A), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase‑1 (HPRT1) and TATA box binding protein (TBP) in order to identify the most stable and suitable reference genes for use in expression studies in non‑small cell lung cancer. The mRNA expression encoding the panel of the 10 HKGs was determined using reverse transcription‑quantitative PCR (RT‑qPCR) in human lung cancer cell lines. Three software programs, BestKeeper, NormFinder and geNorm, were used to ascertain the most suitable reference genes to normalize the RNA input. The present study examined three lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI‑H446 and NCI‑H460). The analysis of the experimental data using BestKeeper software revealed that all 10 HKGs were stable, with GADPH, followed by 18S being the most stable genes and PPIA and HPRT1 being the least stable genes. The NormFinder software results demonstrated that PPIA followed by ACTB were the most stable and B2M and RPLP0 were the least stable. The geNorm software results revealed that ACTB and PGK1, followed by PPIA were the most stable genes and B2M and RPLP0 were identified as the least stable genes. Due to discrepancies in the ranking orders of the reference genes obtained by different analyzing software programs, it was not possible to determine a single universal reference gene. The suitability of selected reference genes requires unconditional validation prior to each study. Based on the three analyzing programs, ACTB, PPIA and PGK1 were the most stable reference genes in lung cancer cell lines.",2016-03-04,"Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Genes, Essential, Genetic Association Studies, Humans, Lung Neoplasms, Models, Statistical, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",Mol Med Rep,10.3892/mmr.2015.3159,Ali
31344488,A novel defective recombinant porcine enterovirus G virus carrying a porcine torovirus papain-like cysteine protease gene and a putative anti-apoptosis gene in place of viral structural protein genes.,"Enterovirus G (EV-G) belongs to the family of Picornaviridae. Two types of recombinant porcine EV-Gs carrying papain-like cysteine protease (PLCP) gene of porcine torovirus, a virus in Coronaviridae, are reported. Type 1 recombinant EV-Gs are detected in pig feces in Japan, USA, and Belgium and carry the PLPC gene at the junction site of 2C/3A genes, while PLPC gene replaces the viral structural genes in type 2 recombinant EV-G detected in pig feces in a Chinese farm. We identified a novel type 2 recombinant EV-G carrying the PLCP gene with flanking sequences in place of the viral structural genes in pig feces in Japan. The ~0.3 kb-long upstream flanking sequence had no sequence homology with any proteins deposited in GenBank, while the downstream ~0.9 kb-long flanking sequence included a domain having high amino acid sequence homology with a baculoviral inhibitor of apoptosis repeat superfamily. The pig feces, where the novel type 2 recombinant EV-G was detected, also carried type 1 recombinant EV-G. The amount of type 1 and type 2 recombinant EV-G genomes was almost same in the pig feces. Although the phylogenetic analysis suggested that these two recombinant EV-Gs have independently evolved, type 1 recombinant EV-G might have served as a helper virus by providing viral structural proteins for dissemination of the type 2 recombinant EV-G.",2020-04-20,"Animals, Apoptosis Regulatory Proteins, Cysteine Proteases, Enterovirus Infections, Enteroviruses, Porcine, Feces, Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic, Gene Expression Regulation, Viral, Phylogeny, Swine, Swine Diseases, Viral Structural Proteins",Infect Genet Evol,,Imai

27886269,In silico clustering of Salmonella global gene expression data reveals novel genes co-regulated with the SPI-1 virulence genes through HilD.,"A wide variety of Salmonella enterica serovars cause intestinal and systemic infections to humans and animals. Salmonella Patogenicity Island 1 (SPI-1) is a chromosomal region containing 39 genes that have crucial virulence roles. The AraC-like transcriptional regulator HilD, encoded in SPI-1, positively controls the expression of the SPI-1 genes, as well as of several other virulence genes located outside SPI-1. In this study, we applied a clustering method to the global gene expression data of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium from the COLOMBOS database; thus genes that show an expression pattern similar to that of SPI-1 genes were selected. This analysis revealed nine novel genes that are co-expressed with SPI-1, which are located in different chromosomal regions. Expression analyses and protein-DNA interaction assays showed regulation by HilD for six of these genes: gtgE, phoH, sinR, SL1263 (lpxR) and SL4247 were regulated directly, whereas SL1896 was regulated indirectly. Interestingly, phoH is an ancestral gene conserved in most of bacteria, whereas the other genes show characteristics of genes acquired by Salmonella. A role in virulence has been previously demonstrated for gtgE, lpxR and sinR. Our results further expand the regulon of HilD and thus identify novel possible Salmonella virulence genes.",2018-06-01,"Animals, Bacterial Proteins, Chromosome Mapping, Computational Biology, Computer Simulation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Salmonella typhimurium, Transcription Factors, Virulence Factors",Sci Rep,,Martínez-Flores
28572585,Gene-body CG methylation and divergent expression of duplicate genes in rice.,"Gene and genome duplication fosters genetic novelty, but redundant gene copies would undergo mutational decay unless preserved via selective or neutral forces. Molecular mechanisms mediating duplicate preservation remain incompletely understood. Several recent studies showed an association between DNA methylation and expression divergence of duplicated genes and suggested a role of epigenetic mechanism in duplicate retention. Here, we compare genome-wide gene-body CG methylation (BCGM) and duplicate gene expression between a rice mutant null for OsMet1-2(a major CG methytransferase in rice) and its isogenic wild-type. We demonstrate a causal link between BCGM divergence and expression difference of duplicate copies. Interestingly, the higher- and lower-expressing copies of duplicates as separate groups show broadly different responses with respect to direction of expression alteration upon loss of BCGM. A role for BCGM in conditioning expression divergence between copies of duplicates generally holds for duplicates generated by whole genome duplication (WGD) or by small-scale duplication processes. However, differences are evident among these categories, including a higher proportion of WGD duplicates manifesting expression alteration, and differential propensities to lose BCGM by the higher- and lower-expression copies in the mutant. Together, our results support the notion that differential epigenetic marking may facilitate long-term retention of duplicate genes.",2018-12-14,"DNA Methylation, Epigenesis, Genetic, Evolution, Molecular, Genes, Duplicate, Genes, Plant, Oryza",Sci Rep,,Wang

23494636,Screening key genes and pathways in glioma based on gene set enrichment analysis and meta-analysis.,"Glioma is a highly invasive, rapidly spreading form of brain cancer, while its etiology is largely unknown. A few recently reported studies have been developed using gene expression microarrays of glioma to identify differentially expressed genes from several to hundreds. This study was designed to analyze vast amounts of glioma-related microarray data and screen the key genes and pathways related to the development and progression of glioma. We used gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and meta-analysis of seven included studies after standardized microarray preprocessing, which increased concordance between these gene datasets. After GSEA, there were 14 mixing pathways including 13 up- and 1 down-regulated pathways. Based on the meta-analysis, 268 significant genes were screened out (P < 0.05); there were 249 genes identified by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and 27 KEGG pathways closely related to the set of the imported genes were identified. At last, six consistent pathways and key genes in these pathways related to glioma were obtained with combined GSEA and meta-analysis. The gene pathways that we identified could provide insight concerning the development of glioma.

30213980,G2Vec: Distributed gene representations for identification of cancer prognostic genes.,"Identification of cancer prognostic genes is important in that it can lead to accurate outcome prediction and better therapeutic trials for cancer patients. Many computational approaches have been proposed to achieve this goal; however, there is room for improvement. Recent developments in deep learning techniques can aid in the identification of better prognostic genes and more accurate outcome prediction, but one of the main problems in the adoption of deep learning for this purpose is that data from cancer patients have too many dimensions, while the number of samples is relatively small. In this study, we propose a novel network-based deep learning method to identify prognostic gene signatures via distributed gene representations generated by G2Vec, which is a modified Word2Vec model originally used for natural language processing. We applied the proposed method to five cancer types including liver cancer and showed that G2Vec outperformed extant feature selection methods, especially for small number of samples. Moreover, biomarkers identified by G2Vec was useful to find significant prognostic gene modules associated with hepatocellular carcinoma.",2019-11-04,"Algorithms, Biomarkers, Tumor, Carcinoma, Hepatocellular, Computational Biology, Deep Learning, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Neoplasms, Oncogenes, Prognosis",Sci Rep,,Choi

32084215,Weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified six hub genes associated with rupture of intracranial aneurysms.,"Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are characterized by localized dilation or ballooning of a cerebral artery. When IAs rupture, blood leaks into the space around the brain to create a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The latter is associated with a higher risk of disability and mortality. The aims of this study were to gain greater insight into the pathogenesis of ruptured IAs, and to clarify whether identified hub genes represent potential biological markers for assessing the likelihood of IA progression and rupture. Briefly, the GSE36791 and GSE73378 datasets from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database were reanalyzed and subjected to a weighted gene co-expression network analysis to test the association between gene sets and clinical features. The clinical significance of these genes as potential biomarkers was also examined, with their expression validated by quantitative real-time PCR. A total of 14 co-expression modules and 238 hub genes were identified. In particular, three modules (labeled turquoise, blue, and brown) were found to highly correlate with IA rupture events. Additionally, six potential biomarkers were identified (BASP1, CEBPB, ECHDC2, GZMK, KLHL3, and SLC2A3), which are strongly associated with the progression and rupture of IAs. Taken together, these findings provide novel insights into potential molecular mechanisms responsible for IAs and they highlight the potential for these particular genes to serve as biomarkers for monitoring IA rupture.",2020-05-11,"Aneurysm, Ruptured, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Intracranial Aneurysm, Male, Middle Aged, Molecular Sequence Annotation",PLoS One,,Wang
30359739,Identification of novel C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes in rye (Secale cereale L.) and expression studies.,"Although rye is one of the most cold-tolerant species among temperate cereals, its huge and complex genome has prevented us from identifying agronomically useful genes. However, advances in high-throughput sequencing technology are making it increasingly possible to investigate its genome. The C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene family controls cold tolerance in plants and its members are well conserved among eudicots and monocots, among which there are diverse homologs. Despite its large genome, only a small number of CBF genes have been identified in rye. In this study, we explored high-throughput sequencing data of the rye genome and identified 12 novel CBF genes. Sequence analyses revealed that these genes contain signature sequences of the CBF family. Chromosomal localization of the genes by PCR using wheat-rye addition lines showed that most of these are located on the long arm of chromosome 5, but also on the long arm of chromosomes 2 and 6. On the basis of comparative analyses of CBF family members in the Triticeae, CBF proteins were divided into several groups according to phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs. Light is essential to fully induce CBF gene expression and there is specificity in the response to different types of abiotic stresses in ScCBF genes.

Cytoscape, String tools and DAVID tools were used to investigate the biological pathways encoded by the genes identified as being either upregulated or downregulated in CRC, to determine protein‑protein interactions and to identify potential hub genes associated with CRC. As a result, a total of 3,264 genes were identified as being differentially expressed in CRC and adjacent tissues, including 1,594 downregulated and 1,670 upregulated genes. Furthermore, 306 genes were revealed to be clustered in a complex interaction network, and the top 20 hub genes in this network were determined by application of the Matthews Correlation Coefficient algorithm. In addition, the patterns of the expression levels of the 20 hub genes were investigated using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that four of the 20 hub genes encoded small subunit processome components (UTP3 small subunit processome component; UTP14 small subunit processome component; UTP 18 small subunit processome component; and UTP20 small subunit processome component) and a further four encoded WD repeat domains (WD repeat‑containing protein 3, WD repeat domain 12, WD repeat‑containing protein 43 and WD repeat‑containing protein 75).

Here, we developed a genome-wide cotton ILPs based on orthologs annotation from two sequenced diploid species, A-genome Gossypium arboreum and D-genome G. raimondii. We identified 10,180 putative ILP markers from 5,021 orthologous genes. Among these, 535 ILP markers from 9 gene families related to stress were selected for experimental verification. Polymorphic rates were 72.71% between G. arboreum and G. raimondii and 36.45% between G. hirsutum acc. TM-1 and G. barbadense cv. Hai7124. Furthermore, 14 polymorphic ILP markers were detected in 264 G. hirsutum accessions. Coupled with previous simple sequence repeats (SSRs) evaluations and salt tolerance assays from the same individuals, we found a total of 25 marker-trait associations involved in nine ILPs. The nine genes, temporally named as C1 to C9, showed the various expressions in different organs and tissues, and five genes (C3, C4, C5, C7 and C9) were significantly upregulated after salt treatment.

Apart from clinical environments, soil ecosystems also represent a major source of antibiotic resistance determinants, which can potentially disseminate across distinct microbial habitats and be acquired by human pathogens via horizontal gene transfer. Therefore, it is of global importance to retrieve comprehensive information on environmental factors, contributing to an accumulation of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in these ecosystems. Here, medically relevant antibiotic resistance genes, class 1 integrons and IncP-1 plasmids were quantified via real time quantitative PCR in soils derived from temperate grasslands and forests, varying in land use over a large spatial scale.

29882491,Molecular Characterization of Eye Pigmentation-Related ABC Transporter Genes in the Ladybird Beetle Harmonia axyridis Reveals Striking Gene Duplication of the white Gene.,"Many species of ladybird beetles (Coccinellidae) possess vivid body colors. These colors and patterns show diversity between coccinellid species, or even within species. However, the molecular underpinnings of these striking body colors are scarcely understood. One of the candidate pigmentation molecules responsible for ladybird body color is ommochrome pigment, which is well known as the red pigment molecule responsible for the red eyes of Drosophila. Various insects also use ommochrome in body coloration. It is known that ommochrome pigment precursors are imported into appropriate cells by the ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins White and Scarlet. Thus, these ABC transporter genes are potentially involved in various color and pattern expressions seen in ladybird beetle species. In this study, in order to identify the repertory of ABC transporter genes responsible for such body colors, we performed molecular characterization of pigment-related ABC transporter genes, especially white and scarlet, in the coccinellid Harmonia axyridis. By using whole genome data for H. axyridis and subsequent RACE-PCR, six white orthologs and one scarlet ortholog were successfully identified. According to the results of functional analyses via RNA interference (RNAi), only one of these genes had a major function in eye pigmentation.

29257295,Identification of key pathogenic genes of sepsis based on the Gene Expression Omnibus database.,"Sepsis is a life-threatening condition in which an uncontrolled inflammatory host response is triggered. The exact pathogenesis of sepsis remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to identify key genes that may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of sepsis. mRNA expression data from blood samples taken from patients with sepsis and healthy individuals was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups were identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, and protein‑protein interaction (PPI) network construction, was performed to investigate the function of the identified DEGs. Furthermore, for validation of these results, the expression levels of several DEGs were analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative‑polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) in three patients with sepsis and three healthy blood samples to support the results obtained from the bioinformatics analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were also used to analyze the diagnostic ability of the identified DEGs for sepsis. The results demonstrated that a total of 4,402 DEGs, including 1,960 upregulated and 2,442 downregulated genes, were identified between patients with sepsis and healthy individuals. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that 39 DEGs were significantly enriched in toll‑like receptor signaling pathways. The top 20 upregulated and downregulated DEGs were used to construct the PPI network. Hub genes with high degrees, including interleukin 1 receptor‑associated kinase 3 (IRAK3), S100 calcium‑binding protein (S100)A8, angiotensin II receptor‑associated protein (AGTRAP) and S100A9, were demonstrated to be associated sepsis. Furthermore, RT‑qPCR results demonstrated that IRAK3, adrenomedullin (ADM), arachidonate 5‑lipoxygenase (ALOX5), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and S100A8 were significantly upregulated, while ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1) was upregulated but not significantly, in blood samples from patients with sepsis compared with healthy individuals, which was consistent with bioinformatics analysis results. Therefore, AGTRAP, IRAK3, ADM, ALOX5, MMP9, S100A8 and ENTPD1 were identified to have potential diagnostic value in sepsis. In conclusion, dysregulated levels of the AGTRAP, IRAK3, ADM, ALOX5, MMP9, S100A8 and ENTPD1 genes may be involved in sepsis pathophysiology and may be utilized as potential diagnostic biomarkers or therapeutic targets.",2018-08-20,"Computational Biology, Databases, Genetic, Down-Regulation, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Ontology, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Protein Interaction Maps, RNA, Messenger, Sepsis, Signal Transduction, Up-Regulation",Mol Med Rep,,Lu
28986317,Acute hypoxia stress induced abundant differential expression genes and alternative splicing events in heart of tilapia.,"Hypoxia is one of the critical environmental stressors for fish in aquatic environments. Although accumulating evidences indicate that gene expression is regulated by hypoxia stress in fish, how genes undergoing differential gene expression and/or alternative splicing (AS) in response to hypoxia stress in heart are not well understood. Using RNA-seq, we surveyed and detected 289 differential expressed genes (DEG) and 103 genes that undergo differential usage of exons and splice junctions events (DUES) in heart of a hypoxia tolerant fish, Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus following 12h hypoxic treatment. The spatio-temporal expression analysis validated the significant association of differential exon usages in two randomly selected DUES genes (fam162a and ndrg2) in 5 tissues (heart, liver, brain, gill and spleen) sampled at three time points (6h, 12h, and 24h) under acute hypoxia treatment. Functional analysis significantly associated the differential expressed genes with the categories related to energy conservation, protein synthesis and immune response. Different enrichment categories were found between the DEG and DUES dataset. The Isomerase activity, Oxidoreductase activity, Glycolysis and Oxidative stress process were significantly enriched for the DEG gene dataset, but the Structural constituent of ribosome and Structural molecule activity, Ribosomal protein and RNA binding protein were significantly enriched only for the DUES genes. Our comparative transcriptomic analysis reveals abundant stress responsive genes and their differential regulation function in the heart tissues of Nile tilapia under acute hypoxia stress. Our findings will facilitate future investigation on transcriptome complexity and AS regulation during hypoxia stress in fish.",2017-12-27,"Alternative Splicing, Animals, Exons, Gene Expression, High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing, Hypoxia, Stress, Physiological, Tilapia",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.10.002,Xia
28476574,"Association of gene variants of transcription factors PPARγ, RUNX2, Osterix genes and COL2A1, IGFBP3 genes with the development of osteonecrosis of the femoral head in Chinese population.","The molecular pathogenesis of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) has been remained obscure so that its prevalence has been increasing in recent decades. Different transcription factors play critical roles in maintaining the balance between osteogenesis and adipogenesis. However, it has been unclear that the genes variants of the transcription factors exert the effects on the imbalance between steogenesis and adipogenesis during the development of ONFH. Here, we selected the 11SNPs from steogenesis, adipogenesis-specific transcription factors RUNX2, Osterix, and PPARγ genes, chondrogenesis or adipogenesis key factors COL2A1, IGFBP3 genes and analysed the genotypes, alleles, haplotypes and their association with the risk and clinical phenotypes of ONFH through Mass ARRAY® platformin in 200 ONFH patients and 177controls. The patients with ONFH (132 males, 68 females; age: 53.46±11.48yr) were consecutively enrolled at the Department of Orthopedics, the Second Clinical College of Jilin University, from March 2014 to June 2015 and were diagnosed and classified into 10 cases of stage II (5.6%), 54 cases of stage III (30.2%) and 115 cases (64.2%) of stage IV and alcohol-induced (71 cases (39.7%)), idiopathic (64 cases (34.0%)), and steroid-induced osteonecrosis (47 cases (26.3%)) subgroup, respectively. Our results showed that all models of logistical regression analysis, the co-dominants, dominants, and recessives of PPARγrs2920502, significantly associated with the increased risk of ONFH (p=0.004, p=0.013, p=0.016), respectively. Both the minor homozygous CC genotype and the allele C of rs2920502 were evidently correlated with the enhanced risk of ONFH (p=0.005, p=0.0005),respectively. The recessives models of IGFBP3rs2132572 (G/A) as well as RUNX2 rs3763190(G/A) were statistically associated with the higher ONFH risk, p=0.030, p=0.029, respectively; the minor homozygous(AA) of IGFBP3rs2132572 (G/A) was also related to the increased risk of bilateral hips lesions, p=0.039. Moreover, the ages on set of major homozygous(GG) and heterozygous(GT) of COL2A1rs2070739(G/A) were significantly younger than that of the minor homozygous(AA) of the SNP(p=0.008) while the A-T-G-A haplotype of COL2A1 gene revealed significant association with the decreased the risk of bilateral hip lesions, p=0.01, OR:0.258. More important, the serum HDL-c level and the ratio of LDL-c/HDL-c in the ONFH group were significantly decreased and increased compared with those of the control group (p=0.02, p=0.0001), respectively. Particularly, the CC genotype of PPARγ rs2920502 was statistically correlated with the enhanced serum TG level, p=0.011.These results suggest that the variants of PPARγ, RUNX2, COL2A1, and IGFBP3 genes closely associated with the development of ONFH.",2018-03-19,"Adult, Alleles, Asian Continental Ancestry Group, China, Collagen Type II, Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit, Female, Femur Head Necrosis, Genetic Predisposition to Disease, Genotype, Haplotypes, Heterozygote, Homozygote, Humans, Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 3, Male, Middle Aged, PPAR gamma, Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide, Sp7 Transcription Factor",Bone,10.1016/j.bone.2017.05.002,Song

Identifying characteristic genes of PTC are of great importance to reveal its potential genetic mechanisms. In this paper, we proposed a framework, as well as a measure named Normalized Centrality Measure (NCM), to identify characteristic genes of PTC. The framework consisted of four steps. First, both up-regulated genes and down-regulated genes, collectively called differentially expressed genes (DEGs), were screened and integrated together from four datasets, that is, GSE3467, GSE3678, GSE33630, and GSE58545; second, an interaction network of DEGs was constructed, where each node represented a gene and each edge represented an interaction between linking nodes; third, both traditional measures and the NCM measure were used to analyze the topological properties of each node in the network. Compared with traditional measures, more genes related to PTC were identified by the NCM measure; fourth, by mining the high-density subgraphs of this network and performing Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis, several meaningful results were captured, most of which were demonstrated to be associated with PTC. The experimental results proved that this network framework and the NCM measure are useful for identifying more characteristic genes of PTC.",2019-11-11,"Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Thyroid Cancer, Papillary, Thyroid Neoplasms",Genes (Basel),,Shang
26142104,Genome-wide analysis of the MYB gene family in physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.).,"The MYB proteins comprise one of the largest transcription factor families in plants, and play key roles in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism, and stress responses. A total of 125 MYB genes (JcMYB) have been identified in the physic nut (Jatropha curcas L.) genome, including 120 2R-type MYB, 4 3R-MYB, and 1 4R-MYB genes. Based on exon-intron arrangement of MYBs from both lower (Physcomitrella patens) and higher (physic nut, Arabidopsis, and rice) plants, we can classify plant MYB genes into ten groups (MI-X), except for MIX genes which are nonexistent in higher plants. We also observed that MVIII genes may be one of the most ancient MYB types which consist of both R2R3- and 3R-MYB genes. Most MYB genes (76.8% in physic nut) belong to the MI group which can be divided into 34 subgroups. The JcMYB genes were nonrandomly distributed on its 11 linkage groups (LGs). The expansion of MYB genes across several subgroups was observed and resulted from genome triplication of ancient dicotyledons and from both ancient and recent tandem duplication events in the physic nut genome. The expression patterns of several MYB duplicates in the physic nut showed differences in four tissues (root, stem, leaf, and seed), and 34 MYB genes responded to at least one abiotic stressor (drought, salinity, phosphate starvation, and nitrogen starvation) in leaves and/or roots based on the data analysis of digital gene expression tags. Overexpression of the JcMYB001 gene in Arabidopsis increased its sensitivity to drought and salinity stresses.

31599055,Two genes in a pathogenicity gene cluster encoding secreted proteins are required for appressorial penetration and infection of the maize anthracnose fungus Colletotrichum graminicola.,"To avoid pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition, the hemibiotrophic maize pathogen Colletotrichum graminicola secretes proteins mediating the establishment of biotrophy. Targeted deletion of 26 individual candidate genes and seven gene clusters comprising 32 genes of C. graminicola identified a pathogenicity cluster (CLU5) of five co-linear genes, all of which, with the exception of CLU5b, encode secreted proteins. Targeted deletion of all genes of CLU5 revealed that CLU5a and CLU5d are required for full appressorial penetration competence, with virulence deficiencies independent of the host genotype and organ inoculated. Cytorrhysis experiments and microscopy showed that Δclu5a mutants form pressurized appressoria, but they are hampered in forming penetration pores and fail to differentiate a penetration peg. Whereas Δclu5d mutants elicited WT-like papillae, albeit at increased frequencies, papillae induced by Δclu5a mutants were much smaller than those elicited by the WT. Synteny of CLU5 is not only conserved in Colletotrichum spp. but also in additional species of Sordariomycetes including insect pathogens and saprophytes suggesting importance of CLU5 for fungal biology. Since CLU5a and CLU5d also occur in non-pathogenic fungi and since they are expressed prior to plant invasion and even in vegetative hyphae, the encoded proteins probably do not act primarily as effectors.",2020-05-11,"Colletotrichum, Fungal Proteins, Hyphae, Multigene Family, Plant Diseases, Sequence Deletion, Virulence, Zea mays",Environ Microbiol,10.1111/1462-2920.14819,Eisermann
30993004,Gene discovery informatics toolkit defines candidate genes for unexplained infertility and prenatal or infantile mortality.,"Despite a recent surge in novel gene discovery, genetic causes of prenatal-lethal phenotypes remain poorly defined. To advance gene discovery in prenatal-lethal disorders, we created an easy-to-mine database integrating known human phenotypes with inheritance pattern, scores of genetic constraint, and murine and cellular knockout phenotypes-then critically assessed defining features of known prenatal-lethal genes, among 3187 OMIM genes, and relative to 16,009 non-disease genes. While around one-third (39%) of protein-coding genes are essential for murine development, we curate only 3% (624) of human protein-coding genes linked currently to prenatal/infantile lethal disorders. 75% prenatal-lethal genes are linked to developmental lethality in knockout mice, compared to 54% for all OMIM genes and 34% among non-disease genes. Genetic constraint correlates with inheritance pattern (autosomal recessive <autosomal dominant <X-linked), and is greatest among prenatal-lethal genes. Importantly, >90% of recessive genes show neither missense nor loss-of-function constraint, even for prenatal-lethal genes. Detailed ontology mapping for 624 prenatal-lethal genes shows marked enrichment among dominant genes for nuclear proteins with roles in RNA/DNA biology, with recessive genes enriched in cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) metabolic proteins. We conclude that genes without genetic constraint should not be excluded as potential novel disease genes, and especially for recessive conditions (<10% constrained). Prenatal lethal genes are 5.9-fold more likely to be associated with a lethal murine phenotype than non-disease genes. Cell essential genes are largely a subset of mouse-lethal genes, notably under-represented among known OMIM genes, and strong candidates for gamete/embryo non-viability. We therefore curate 3435 'candidate developmental lethal' human genes: essential for murine development or cellular viability, not yet linked to human disorders, presenting strong candidates for unexplained infertility and prenatal/infantile mortality.",,,NPJ Genom Med,,Dawes

The tool offers user-friendly platforms to analyze the anatomical effects of individual genes, and identify trends within groups of genes. We demonstrate how Gene ORGANizer can be used to make new discoveries, showing that chromosome X is enriched with genes affecting facial features, that positive selection targets genes with more constrained phenotypic effects, and more.

Germplasm using quantitative real-time PCR.,"Quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction has been applied in a vast range of studies of gene expression analysis. However, real-time PCR data must be normalized with one or more reference genes. In this study, eleven putative consistently expressed genes (ACT, TUA, TUB, CYP, DNAj, ELFA, F-box27, RPL12, GAPDH, UBC and UBQ) in nine Siberian Apricot Germplasms (including much variability) were evaluated for their potential as references for the normalization of gene expression by NormFinder and geNorm programs. From our studies, ACT, UBC, CYP, UBQ and RPL12 as suitable for normalization were identified by geNorm, while UBC and CYP as the best pair by NormFinder. Moreover, UBC was selected as the most stably expressed gene by both algorithms in different Siberian Apricot seed samples. We also detected that a set of three genes (ACT, CYP and UBC) by geNorm as control for normalization could lead to accurate results. Furthermore, the expression levels of oleosin gene were analyzed to validate the suitability of the selected reference genes.

29481587,Functional divergence of duplicate genes several million years after gene duplication in Arabidopsis.,"Lineage-specific duplicated genes likely contribute to the phenotypic divergence in closely related species. However, neither the frequency of duplication events nor the degree of selection pressures immediately after gene duplication is clear in the speciation process. Here, using Illumina DNA-sequencing reads from Arabidopsis halleri, which has multiple closely related species with high-quality genome assemblies (A. thaliana and A. lyrata), we succeeded in generating orthologous gene groups in Brassicaceae. The duplication frequency of retained genes in the Arabidopsis lineage was ∼10 times higher than the duplication frequency inferred by comparative genomics of Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and moss (Physcomitrella patens). The difference of duplication frequencies can be explained by a rapid decay of anciently duplicated genes. To examine the degree of selection pressure on genes duplicated in either the A. halleri-lyrata or the A. halleri lineage, we examined positive and purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages throughout the ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rates (KA/KS). Duplicate genes tended to have a higher proportion of positive selection compared with non-duplicated genes. Interestingly, we found that functional divergence of duplicated genes was accelerated several million years after gene duplication compared with immediately after gene duplication.",,,DNA Res,,Hanada
26163927,A knowledge driven supervised learning approach to identify gene network of differentially up-regulated genes during neuronal senescence in Rattus norvegicus.,"Various approaches have been described to infer the gene interaction network from expression data. Several models based on computational and mathematical methods are available. The fundamental thing in the identification of the gene interaction is their biological relevance. Two genes belonging to the same pathway are more likely to affect the expression of each other than the genes of two different pathways. In the present study, interaction network of genes is described based on upregulated genes during neuronal senescence in the Cerebellar granule neurons of rat. We have adopted a supervised learning method and used it in combination with biological pathway information of the genes to develop a gene interaction network. Further modular analysis of the network has been done to identify senescence-related marker genes. Currently there is no adequate information available about the genes implicated in neuronal senescence. Thus identifying multipath genes belonging to the pathway affected by senescence might be very useful in studying the senescence process.

28356169,The KL24 gene cluster and a genomic island encoding a Wzy polymerase contribute genes needed for synthesis of the K24 capsular polysaccharide by the multiply antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolate RCH51.,"The whole-genome sequence of the multiply antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolate RCH51 belonging to sequence type ST103 (Institut Pasteur scheme) revealed that the set of genes at the capsule locus, KL24, includes four genes predicted to direct the synthesis of 3-acetamido-3,6-dideoxy-d-galactose (d-Fuc3NAc), and this sugar was found in the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). One of these genes, fdtE, encodes a novel bifunctional protein with an N-terminal FdtA 3,4-ketoisomerase domain and a C-terminal acetyltransferase domain. KL24 lacks a gene encoding a Wzy polymerase to link the oligosaccharide K units to form the CPS found associated with isolate RCH51, and a wzy gene was found in a small genomic island (GI) near the cpn60 gene. This GI is in precisely the same location as another GI carrying wzy and atr genes recently found in several A. baumannii isolates, but it does not otherwise resemble it. The CPS isolated from RCH51, studied by sugar analysis and 1D and 2D 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, revealed that the K unit has a branched pentasaccharide structure made up of Gal, GalNAc and GlcNAc residues with d-Fuc3NAc as a side branch, and the K units are linked via a β-d-GlcpNAc-(1→3)-β-d-Galp linkage formed by the Wzy encoded by the GI. The functions of the glycosyltransferases encoded by KL24 were assigned to formation of specific bonds. A correspondence between the order of the genes in KL24 and other KL and the order of the linkages they form was noted, and this may be useful in future predictions of glycosyltransferase specificities.",2017-10-10,"Acetylgalactosamine, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacterial Capsules, Bacterial Proteins, Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial, Fucose, Genome, Bacterial, Genomic Islands, Glycosyltransferases, Humans, Membrane Proteins, Multigene Family, Polysaccharides, Bacterial",Microbiology,10.1099/mic.0.000430,Kenyon

29133816,Disruption of diphthamide synthesis genes and resulting toxin resistance as a robust technology for quantifying and optimizing CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing.,"We have devised an effective and robust method for the characterization of gene-editing events. The efficacy of editing-mediated mono- and bi-allelic gene inactivation and integration events is quantified based on colony counts. The combination of diphtheria toxin (DT) and puromycin (PM) selection enables analyses of 10,000-100,000 individual cells, assessing hundreds of clones with inactivated genes per experiment. Mono- and bi-allelic gene inactivation is differentiated by DT resistance, which occurs only upon bi-allelic inactivation. PM resistance indicates integration. The robustness and generalizability of the method were demonstrated by quantifying the frequency of gene inactivation and cassette integration under different editing approaches: CRISPR/Cas9-mediated complete inactivation was ~30-50-fold more frequent than cassette integration. Mono-allelic inactivation without integration occurred >100-fold more frequently than integration. Assessment of gRNA length confirmed 20mers to be most effective length for inactivation, while 16-18mers provided the highest overall integration efficacy. The overall efficacy was ~2-fold higher for CRISPR/Cas9 than for zinc-finger nuclease and was significantly increased upon modulation of non-homologous end joining or homology-directed repair. The frequencies and ratios of editing events were similar for two different DPH genes (independent of the target sequence or chromosomal location), which indicates that the optimization parameters identified with this method can be generalized.",2019-07-23,"Alleles, CRISPR-Cas Systems, Diphtheria Toxin, Gene Editing, Gene Knockout Techniques, Genetic Vectors, Histidine, Humans, MCF-7 Cells, Minor Histocompatibility Antigens, Proteins, Puromycin, Transfection, Transgenes, Tumor Suppressor Proteins",Sci Rep,,Killian
29314059,Genetic and epigenetic divergence of duplicate genes in two legume species.,"Soybean (Glycine max) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) share a polyploidy event ~59 MYA, followed by a Glycine-specific whole genome duplication (WGD) ~8-13 MYA. Duplicated genes were classified into five categories: singletons, dispersed, proximal, tandem, or WGD/segmental and found strong correlations between gene category and functional annotation. Photosynthesis and transcriptional regulation-related Gene Ontology terms were significantly over-represented in singletons and WGD genes, respectively, aligning with the gene balance hypothesis. We found that the divergence of gene expression and DNA methylation between WGD-derived paralogs increased with age and that WGD genes, initially retained via dosage constraints, subsequently underwent expression divergence, associated with other factors such as DNA methylation. Genes derived from different modes of duplication differed in breadth, level, and specificity of expression in both species. Orthologous genes and ungrouped genes (genes not in an ortholog group) differed in expression patterns.

A perennial dioecious plant, the red bayberry genome has been published recently, providing the opportunity to analyze the MADS-box gene family and its role in fruit development and ripening. Here, we identified 54 MADS-box genes in the red bayberry genome, and classified them into two types based on phylogenetic analysis. Thirteen Type I MADS-box genes were subdivided into three subfamilies and 41 Type II MADS-box genes into 13 subfamilies. A total of 46 MADS-box genes were distributed across eight red bayberry chromosomes, and the other eight genes were located on the unmapped scaffolds. Transcriptome analysis suggested that the expression of most Type II genes was higher than Type I in five female tissues. Moreover, 26 MADS-box genes were expressed during red bayberry fruit development and ten of them showed high expression. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of MrMADS01 (SEP, MIKC",2019-09-09,"Fruit, Gene Expression Regulation, Plant, Genome, Plant, Genome-Wide Association Study, MADS Domain Proteins, Multigene Family, Myricaceae, Phylogeny, Plant Proteins",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2019.144045,Zhao

31442573,Detection of putative pathogenicity and virulence genes of Erysiphe pisi using genome-wide in-silico search and their suppression by er2 mediated resistance in garden pea.,"The biotrophic fungus, Erysiphe pisi is the chief causal agent of powdery mildew disease of garden pea. A genome-wide search using in-silico approach was carried to detect putative pathogenicity and virulence genes of E. pisi, since information about these genes and their interaction with pea is limited. Nineteen putative pathogenicity gene sequences were detected through genome-wide pathogenicity gene-search and confirmed them to be conserved in E. pisi through genomic PCRs. Fifteen of these genes expressed through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplifying expected band size along with fungal and plant specific internal controls. Gene sequencing and annotation revealed them to be Erysiphe-specific. A time course study was carried to monitor expression of nine of these genes through real-time quantitative (qRT)-PCR in Erysiphe-challenged plants of powdery mildew resistant pea genotype, JI-2480 carrying er2 gene and susceptible pea cultivar, Arkel. Expression of these genes was differentially and temporally regulated. They were found mostly related to signaling; cAMP-PKA (cPKA, CRP and AC) and MAPK (MST7) pathways along with MFP, TRE and PEX which are reported pathogenicity factors in other ascomycete members indicating that similar conserved pathways function in E. pisi also. These genes expressed at higher level at initial hours post inoculation (hpi) as early as 6 hpi in Arkel compared to JI-2480 implying them as pathogenicity factors. The elevated level of expression of MFP, TRE, CRP and cPKA gene sequences in E. pisi-challenged JI-2480 genotype at 12 hpi alone suggests these genes to possess a role in avirulence in JI-2480, conferring er2 mediated resistance.",2020-03-10,"Ascomycota, Computational Biology, Disease Resistance, Gene Expression Profiling, Genes, Fungal, Genome, Fungal, Peas, Plant Diseases, Polymerase Chain Reaction, Sequence Analysis, DNA, Virulence Factors",Microb Pathog,10.1016/j.micpath.2019.103680,Bhosle
25786207,Identification and validation of reference genes for quantification of target gene expression with quantitative real-time PCR for tall fescue under four abiotic stresses.,"Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.) is widely utilized as a major forage and turfgrass species in the temperate regions of the world and is a valuable plant material for studying molecular mechanisms of grass stress tolerance due to its superior drought and heat tolerance among cool-season species. Selection of suitable reference genes for quantification of target gene expression is important for the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying improved growth traits and stress tolerance. The stability of nine potential reference genes (ACT, TUB, EF1a, GAPDH, SAND, CACS, F-box, PEPKR1 and TIP41) was evaluated using four programs, GeNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder. The combinations of SAND and TUB or TIP41 and TUB were most stably expressed in salt-treated roots or leaves. The combinations of GAPDH with TIP41 or TUB were stable in roots and leaves under drought stress. TIP41 and PEPKR1 exhibited stable expression in cold-treated roots, and the combination of F-box, TIP41 and TUB was also stable in cold-treated leaves. CACS and TUB were the two most stable reference genes in heat-stressed roots. TIP41 combined with TUB and ACT was stably expressed in heat-stressed leaves. Finally, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays of the target gene FaWRKY1 using the identified most stable reference genes confirmed the reliability of selected reference genes. The selection of suitable reference genes in tall fescue will allow for more accurate identification of stress-tolerance genes and molecular mechanisms conferring stress tolerance in this stress-tolerant species.

30833587,Selection and Validation of Reference Genes for Gene Expression Studies by RT-PCR in Dalbergia odorifera.,"Perennial tree Dalbergia odorifera T. Chen could form the precious heartwood used to produce chinese traditional medicine, rosewood furniture and fragrances. However the formation of heartwood is time-consuming and low efficient, leading to the severe destruction of its wild resources. Thus, it is urgent to study the molecular mechanism of heartwood formation in D. odorifera. But till now, there is no report about the reference gene selection in this species. In this study, the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes were evaluated across different tissues and stems treated by wound and chemical stimulators. Four algorithms were applied to obtain the robust genes. The results support HIS2, GAPDH, and CYP to be the most stable reference genes in samples under different wound treatments while DNAj was the least stable. In different tissues, HIS2, UBQ, and RPL were the most stable reference genes while DNAj was the least stable. The selected reference genes were validated through the normalization of the qRT-PCR data of six heartwood related genes in terpene biosynthesis pathway and ethylene signal pathway. The results showed that their expression levels were accurate when they were normalized by the most stable reference gene HIS2, or by the combination of the two or three most stable reference genes. These results demonstrated that these selected reference genes are reliable.",,,Sci Rep,,Meng

29353598,New role of LTR-retrotransposons for emergence and expansion of disease-resistance genes and high-copy gene families in plants.,"Long terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-Rs) are major elements creating new genome structure for expansion of plant genomes. However, in addition to the genome expansion, the role of LTR-Rs has been unexplored. In this study, we constructed new reference genome sequences of two pepper species (Capsicum baccatum and C. chinense), and updated the reference genome of C. annuum. We focused on the study for speciation of Capsicum spp. and its driving forces. We found that chromosomal translocation, unequal amplification of LTR-Rs, and recent gene duplications in the pepper genomes as major evolutionary forces for diversification of Capsicum spp. Specifically, our analyses revealed that the nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich-repeat proteins (NLRs) were massively created by LTR-R-driven retroduplication. These retoduplicated NLRs were abundant in higher plants, and most of them were lineage-specific. The retroduplication was a main process for creation of functional disease-resistance genes in Solanaceae plants. In addition, 4-10% of whole genes including highly amplified families such as MADS-box and cytochrome P450 emerged by the retroduplication in the plants. Our study provides new insight into creation of disease-resistance genes and high-copy number gene families by retroduplication in plants.

29407228,Double silencing of relevant genes suggests the existence of the direct link between DNA replication/repair and central carbon metabolism in human fibroblasts.,"Genetic evidence for a link between DNA replication and glycolysis has been demonstrated a decade ago in Bacillus subtilis, where temperature-sensitive mutations in genes coding for replication proteins could be suppressed by mutations in genes of glycolytic enzymes. Then, a strong influence of dysfunctions of particular enzymes from the central carbon metabolism (CCM) on DNA replication and repair in Escherichia coli was reported. Therefore, we asked if such a link occurs only in bacteria or it is a more general phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate that effects of silencing (provoked by siRNA) of expression of genes coding for proteins involved in DNA replication and repair (primase, DNA polymerase ι, ligase IV, and topoisomerase IIIβ) on these processes (less efficient entry into the S phase of the cell cycle and decreased level of DNA synthesis) could be suppressed by silencing of specific genes of enzymes from CMM. Silencing of other pairs of replication/repair and CMM genes resulted in enhancement of the negative effects of lower expression levels of replication/repair genes. We suggest that these results may be proposed as a genetic evidence for the link between DNA replication/repair and CMM in human cells, indicating that it is a common biological phenomenon, occurring from bacteria to humans.",2018-03-13,"Carbon, Cell Cycle, Cell Division, DNA Repair, DNA Replication, Escherichia coli, Fibroblasts, Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial, Gene Silencing, Genes, Bacterial, Humans, Metabolic Networks and Pathways, Organisms, Genetically Modified",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.01.068,Wieczorek

32199950,Identification and expression profiling of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptor genes in Atrijuglans hetaohei.,"Atrijuglans hetaohei Yang (Lepidoptera: Gelechioidea), is one of the major pests that can seriously damage the walnut fruits. Neuropeptides and their receptors regulate most physiological functions in insects and represent new targets for the development of control agents. To identify the neuropeptides and their receptors from A. hetaohei, we sequenced and analyzed its head transcriptomic data, identified 32 neuropeptides and 39 neuropeptide receptor genes. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses suggest that A. hetaohei neuropeptides and receptor genes have high homology with those in Bombyx mori, Chilo suppressalis, Plutella xylostella and Helicoverpa armigera. Moreover, gene expression patterns revealed that neuropeptide genes such as AKH1, CP, MS and PTTH were expressed specifically in male head, while CAP3, DH, NPLP1, PBAN and SIF showed higher expression in the female head. Bur showed abdomen biased expression in both male and female. Neuropeptide receptor genes such as A8, A11, A15 and LGR were highly expressed in male head, whereas A24 and LGR2 were preferentially expressed in female head. This is the first sequencing, identification and expression analyses of neuropeptides and neuropeptide receptor genes from A. hetaohei.

28213042,"Gene duplication, conservation and divergence of Heme oxygenase 2 genes in blunt snout bream (Megalobrama amblycephala) and their responses to hypoxia.","Heme oxygenase (HO) that catalyzes the degradation of heme, is involved in responding and using oxygen in teleost fish. Physiologic heme degradation can be catalyzed by two isozymes of HO (HO-1 and HO-2). In fish, the molecular constructions, expression characteristics and hypoxic regulation of HO-2 are still not well known. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of duplicated HO-2 genes in blunt snout bream, a hypoxia sensitive fish species. Blunt snout bream HO-2a and -2b genes shared a relatively low sequence identity of 67%. The HO-2a and -2b mRNAs were widely expressed in adult tissues. During embryogenesis, HO-2a mRNAs was significantly upregulated at 16hpf and then maintained with high lever, while HO-2b mRNAs was gradually increased at 12hpf and then reduced significantly. Whole-mount in situ hybridization demonstrated that HO-2a and -2b mRNAs mainly detected in brain and eyes at different embryonic stages. The results of acute hypoxia experiment showed that both HO-2a and -2b mRNAs have significant changes in different tissues. Both HO-2a and -2b mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in the brain, but down-regulated in the gill and liver during hypoxia. Under hypoxia, HO-2a mRNA in the heart was significantly increased while HO-2b mRNA was decreased. Embryos in hypoxic conditions at different developmental stages strongly induced the mRNA expression of HO-2a and -2b. These results provide new insights into the functional conservation and divergence of HO-2 genes and improve our understanding of HO-2 responses to hypoxia.",2017-03-15,"Animals, Cloning, Molecular, Cyprinidae, Fish Proteins, Gene Duplication, Heme Oxygenase (Decyclizing), Hypoxia, In Situ Hybridization, Phylogeny, Transcriptome",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2017.02.017,Zhang
32140959,Multifactor dimensionality reduction reveals a strong gene-gene interaction between STC1 and COL11A1 genes as a possible risk factor of knee osteoarthritis.,"Articular cartilage is an avascular tissue with a structure that allows it to support and cushion the overload of the surfaces in contact. It maintains its metabolic functions due to the contribution of different signaling pathways. However, several factors play a role in its deterioration, allowing to the development of osteoarthritis (OA), and one of the major factors is genetic. Our goal was to identify gene-gene interactions (epistasis) between five signaling pathways involved in the articular cartilage metabolism as possible indicators of OA risk. We applied the Multifactor-Dimensionality Reduction (MDR) method to identify and characterize the epistasis between 115 SNPs located in 73 genes related to HIF-1α, Wnt/β-catenin, cartilage extracellular matrix metabolism, oxidative stress, and uric acid transporters. Ninety three patients diagnosed with primary knee OA and 150 healthy controls were included in the study. Genotyping was performed with the OpenArray system, the statistical analysis was carried out with the STATA software v14, and epistasis was analyzed with the MDR software v3.0.2. The MDR analysis revealed that the best interaction model was between polymorphisms rs17786744 of the STC1 gene and rs2615977 of the COL11A1 gene, with an entropy value of 4.44%, CVC 8/10, OR 5.60, 95% CI 3.27-9.59, p < 0.0001.

26371082,Transcriptome-Wide Differential Gene Expression in Bicyclus anynana Butterflies: Female Vision-Related Genes Are More Plastic.,"Vision is energetically costly to maintain. Consequently, over time many cave-adapted species downregulate the expression of vision genes or even lose their eyes and associated eye genes entirely. Alternatively, organisms that live in fluctuating environments, with different requirements for vision at different times, may evolve phenotypic plasticity for expression of vision genes. Here, we use a global transcriptomic and candidate gene approach to compare gene expression in the heads of a polyphenic butterfly. Bicyclus anynana have two seasonal forms that display sexual dimorphism and plasticity in eye morphology, and female-specific plasticity in opsin gene expression. Nonchoosy dry season females downregulate opsin expression, consistent with the high physiological cost of vision. To identify other genes associated with sexually dimorphic and seasonally plastic differences in vision, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data from whole head tissues. We identified two eye development genes (klarsicht and warts homologs) and an eye pigment biosynthesis gene (henna) differentially expressed between seasonal forms. By comparing sex-specific expression across seasonal forms, we found that klarsicht, warts, henna, and another eye development gene (domeless) were plastic in a female-specific manner. In a male-only analysis, white (w) was differentially expressed between seasonal forms. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction confirmed that warts and white are expressed in eyes only, whereas klarsicht, henna and domeless are expressed in both eyes and brain. We find that differential expression of eye development and eye pigment genes is associated with divergent eye phenotypes in B. anynana seasonal forms, and that there is a larger effect of season on female vision-related genes.",2016-09-27,"Animals, Butterflies, Eye, Female, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Male, Opsins, Phenotype, Pigmentation, Sex Characteristics, Transcriptome",Mol Biol Evol,10.1093/molbev/msv197,Macias-Muñoz

Compared to white feather broiler breeds, Chinese local broiler breeds have a slow growth rate. The main genes affecting the growth traits of local chickens in China are still unclear and need to be further explored. This experiment used fast-growth and slow-growth groups of the Jinghai Yellow chicken as the research objects. Three males and three females with similar body weights were selected from the two groups at four weeks old and eight weeks old, respectively, with a total of 24 individuals selected. After slaughter, their chest muscles were taken for transcriptome sequencing. In the differentially expressed genes screening, all of the genes obtained were screened by fold change ≥ 2 and false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05.

24972019,"Phylogenomic analysis of ""red"" genes from two divergent species of the ""green"" secondary phototrophs, the chlorarachniophytes, suggests multiple horizontal gene transfers from the red lineage before the divergence of extant chlorarachniophytes.","The plastids of chlorarachniophytes were derived from an ancestral green alga via secondary endosymbiosis. Thus, genes from the ""green"" lineage via secondary endosymbiotic gene transfer (EGT) are expected in the nuclear genomes of the Chlorarachniophyta. However, several recent studies have revealed the presence of ""red"" genes in their nuclear genomes. To elucidate the origin of such ""red"" genes in chlorarachniophyte nuclear genomes, we carried out exhaustive single-gene phylogenetic analyses, including two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that represent two divergent sister lineages of the Chlorarachniophyta, Amorphochlora amoeboformis ( = Lotharella amoeboformis; based on RNA sequences newly determined here) and Bigelowiella natans (based on the published genome sequence). We identified 10 genes of cyanobacterial origin, phylogenetic analysis of which showed the chlorarachniophytes to branch with the red lineage (red algae and/or red algal secondary or tertiary plastid-containing eukaryotes). Of the 10 genes, 7 demonstrated robust monophyly of the two chlorarachniophyte OTUs. Thus, the common ancestor of the extant chlorarachniophytes likely experienced multiple horizontal gene transfers from the red lineage. Because 4 of the 10 genes are obviously photosynthesis- and/or plastid-related, and almost all of the eukaryotic OTUs in the 10 trees possess plastids, such red genes most likely originated directly from photosynthetic eukaryotes. This situation could be explained by a possible cryptic endosymbiosis of a red algal plastid before the secondary endosymbiosis of the green algal plastid, or a long-term feeding on a single (or multiple closely related) red algal plastid-containing eukaryote(s) after the green secondary endosymbiosis.

For platyrrhines HBG genes, phylogenetic reconstructions of flanking regions recovered orthologous clades with distinct topologies for 5' and 3' flanking regions. The 5' region originated in the common ancestor of platyrrhines but the 3' region had an anthropoid origin. We hypothesize that the platyrrhine HBG genes of 5' and 3' heterophyletic origins arose from subsequent fusions of the (earlier) platyrrhine 5' portion and the (later) anthropoid 3' portion.",2019-02-07,"Animals, Evolution, Molecular, Gene Duplication, Gene Fusion, Genetic Variation, Models, Genetic, Phylogeny, Primates, Pseudogenes, gamma-Globins",J Genet,,Arroyo
30537259,An updated gene atlas for maize reveals organ-specific and stress-induced genes.,"Maize (Zea mays L.), a model species for genetic studies, is one of the two most important crop species worldwide. The genome sequence of the reference genotype, B73, representative of the stiff stalk heterotic group was recently updated (AGPv4) using long-read sequencing and optical mapping technology. To facilitate the use of AGPv4 and to enable functional genomic studies and association of genotype with phenotype, we determined expression abundances for replicated mRNA-sequencing datasets from 79 tissues and five abiotic/biotic stress treatments revealing 36 207 expressed genes. Characterization of the B73 transcriptome across six organs revealed 4154 organ-specific and 7704 differentially expressed (DE) genes following stress treatment. Gene co-expression network analyses revealed 12 modules associated with distinct biological processes containing 13 590 genes providing a resource for further association of gene function based on co-expression patterns. Presence-absence variants (PAVs) previously identified using whole genome resequencing data from 61 additional inbred lines were enriched in organ-specific and stress-induced DE genes suggesting that PAVs may function in phenological variation and adaptation to environment. Relative to core genes conserved across the 62 profiled inbreds, PAVs have lower expression abundances which are correlated with their frequency of dispersion across inbreds and on average have significantly fewer co-expression network connections suggesting that a subset of PAVs may be on an evolutionary path to pseudogenization. To facilitate use by the community, we developed the Maize Genomics Resource website (maize.plantbiology.msu.edu) for viewing and data-mining these resources and deployed two new views on the maize electronic Fluorescent Pictograph Browser (bar.utoronto.ca/efp_maize).",2020-04-06,"Chromosome Mapping, Gene Expression Profiling, Genome, Plant, Genomics, Genotype, Hybrid Vigor, Organ Specificity, Phenotype, Stress, Physiological, Transcriptome, Zea mays",Plant J,,Hoopes

29066959,Gene Network Construction from Microarray Data Identifies a Key Network Module and Several Candidate Hub Genes in Age-Associated Spatial Learning Impairment.,"As humans age many suffer from a decrease in normal brain functions including spatial learning impairments. This study aimed to better understand the molecular mechanisms in age-associated spatial learning impairment (ASLI). We used a mathematical modeling approach implemented in Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to create and compare gene network models of young (learning unimpaired) and aged (predominantly learning impaired) brains from a set of exploratory datasets in rats in the context of ASLI. The major goal was to overcome some of the limitations previously observed in the traditional meta- and pathway analysis using these data, and identify novel ASLI related genes and their networks based on co-expression relationship of genes. This analysis identified a set of network modules in the young, each of which is highly enriched with genes functioning in broad but distinct GO functional categories or biological pathways. Interestingly, the analysis pointed to a single module that was highly enriched with genes functioning in ""learning and memory"" related functions and pathways. Subsequent differential network analysis of this ""learning and memory"" module in the aged (predominantly learning impaired) rats compared to the young learning unimpaired rats allowed us to identify a set of novel ASLI candidate hub genes. Some of these genes show significant repeatability in networks generated from independent young and aged validation datasets. These hub genes are highly co-expressed with other genes in the network, which not only show differential expression but also differential co-expression and differential connectivity across age and learning impairment. The known function of these hub genes indicate that they play key roles in critical pathways, including kinase and phosphatase signaling, in functions related to various ion channels, and in maintaining neuronal integrity relating to synaptic plasticity and memory formation. Taken together, they provide a new insight and generate new hypotheses into the molecular mechanisms responsible for age associated learning impairment, including spatial learning.",,,Front Syst Neurosci,,Uddin
29408272,Prediction of DNA methylation in the promoter of gene suppressor tumor.,"The epigenetics methylation of cytosine is the most common epigenetic form in DNA sequences. It is highly concentrated in the promoter regions of the genes, leading to an inactivation of tumor suppressors regardless of their initial function. In this work, we aim to identify the highly methylated regions; the cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) island located on the promoters and/or the first exon gene known for their key roles in the cell cycle, hence the need to study gene-gene interactions. The Frommer and hidden Markov model algorithms are used as computational methods to identify CpG islands with specificity and sensitivity up to 76% and 80%, respectively. The results obtained show, on the one hand, that the genes studied are suspected of developing hypermethylation in the promoter region of the gene involved in the case of a cancer. We then showed that the relative richness in CG results from a high level of methylation. On the other hand, we observe that the gene-gene interaction exhibits co-expression between the chosen genes. This let us to conclude that the hidden Markov model algorithm predicts more specific and valuable information about the hypermethylation in gene as a preventive and diagnostics tools for the personalized medicine; as that the tumor-suppresser-genes have relative co-expression and complementary relations which the hypermethylation affect in the samples studied in our work.",2018-03-09,"Algorithms, Computational Biology, CpG Islands, DNA Methylation, DNA, Neoplasm, Datasets as Topic, Epistasis, Genetic, Genes, Tumor Suppressor, Humans, Markov Chains, Models, Genetic, Neoplasms, Promoter Regions, Genetic",Gene,10.1016/j.gene.2018.01.082,Saif

31076861,Old and young duplicate genes reveal different responses to environmental changes in Arachis duranensis.,"Old and young duplicate genes have been reported in some organisms. However, little is known about the properties of old and young duplicate genes in Arachis. Here, we have identified old and young duplicate genes in Arachis duranensis, and analyzed the evolution, gene complexity, gene expression pattern, and functional divergence between old and young duplicate genes. Our results showed different evolutionary, gene complexity and gene expression patterns, as well as differing correlations between old and young duplicate genes. Gene ontology results showed that old duplicate genes play a crucial role in lipid and amino acid biosynthesis and the oxidation-reduction process and that young duplicate genes are preferentially involved in photosynthesis and response to biotic stimulus. Transcriptome data sets revealed that most old and young duplicate genes had asymmetric function, and only a few duplicate genes exhibited symmetric function under drought and nematode stress. We found that old duplicate genes are preferentially involved in lipid and amino acid metabolism and response to abiotic stress, while young duplicate genes are likely to participate in photosynthesis and response to biotic stress.

27070752,The importance of the selection of appropriate reference genes for gene expression profiling in adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia of spontaneously hypertensive rat.,"Catecholaminergic system plays an important role in hypertension development. The available results on mRNA expression of catecholaminergic system genes in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are often contradictory. One of the possible causes might be the use of various reference genes as internal controls. In the present study, we searched for suitable reference genes in adrenal medulla or sympathetic ganglia of SHR and Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats, which would enable reliable comparison of mRNA expression between these two strains. The mRNA expression was measured by quantitative real-time PCR in adrenal medulla and superior cervical ganglia of 4-week-old or 24-week-old SHR and WKY rats. We evaluated 12 reference genes by three software tools (Normfinder, BestKeeper, geNorm) and compared them for the standardization of mRNA expression. Combination of reference genes Hprt1 and Ywhaz in adrenal medulla and Gapdh and 18S in sympathetic ganglia were chosen as the best ones. 18S was found as applicable reference gene in both tissues. We found many alterations in expression of catecholaminergic system genes in adrenal medulla and sympathetic ganglia of SHR. The usage of the most or the least stable reference gene as internal control changed results moderately in sympathetic ganglia but seriously in adrenal medulla. For example, tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene was underexpressed in adrenal medulla of adult SHR using the appropriate reference gene but unchanged after the standardization to the least stable reference gene. Our results indicate the importance of appropriate internal control. The suitability of reference genes should be checked again in the case of change in experimental conditions.",2017-03-30,"Adrenal Medulla, Animals, Ganglia, Sympathetic, Gene Expression Profiling, Hypertension, Male, Rats, Inbred SHR, Rats, Inbred WKY, Reference Standards",Physiol Res,10.33549/physiolres.933351,Vavřínová

On the basis of major biological hallmarks, we hypothesized that there must be a uniform gene expression pattern and regulation across cancer types. Among non-coding genes, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as key gene regulators playing powerful roles in cancer. Using TCGA RNAseq data, we analyzed coding (mRNA) and non-coding (lncRNA) gene expression across 15 and 9 common cancer types, respectively. 70 significantly differentially expressed genes common to all 15 cancer types were enlisted. Correlating with protein expression levels from Human Protein Atlas, we observed 34 positively correlated gene sets which are enriched in gene expression, transcription from RNA Pol-II, regulation of transcription and mitotic cell cycle biological processes. Further, 24 lncRNAs were among common significantly differentially expressed non-coding genes. Using guilt-by-association method, we predicted lncRNAs to be involved in same biological processes.

28098899,Analysis of gene expression profiles of non-small cell lung cancer at different stages reveals significantly altered biological functions and candidate genes.,"We attempt to dissect the pathology of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients at different stages and discover the novel candidate genes. Microarray data (GSE21933) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differential expression profiles of lung tumor tissues during different stages were analyzed. The significantly altered functions and pathways were assessed and the key nodes in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were screened out. Then, the coexpression gene pairs and tumor-related genes were assessed. RT-PCR analysis was performed to validate the candidate gene, natural killer-tumor recognition sequence (NKTR). The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for stage IB, IIB, IIIA and IV tumors were 499, 602, 592 and 457, respectively. Most of the DEGs were NSCLC-related genes identified through literature research. A few genes were commonly downregulated in all the 4 stages of tumors, such as CNTN6 and LBX2. The DEGs in early‑stage tumors were closely related with the negative regulation of signal transduction, the apoptosis pathway and the p53 signaling pathway. DEGs in late-stage tumors were significantly enriched in transcription, response to organic substances and synapse regulation-related biological processes. A total of 16 genes (including NKTR) made up the significant coexpression network. NKTR was a key node in the PPI network and was significantly upregulated in lung cancer cells. The mechanism of NSCLC progression in different tumor stages may be different. NKTR may be the target candidate for NSCLC prevention and treatment.",2017-07-13,"Biomarkers, Tumor, Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung, Cells, Cultured, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic, Gene Regulatory Networks, Humans, Lung, Lung Neoplasms, Neoplasm Staging, RNA, Messenger, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Signal Transduction",Oncol Rep,10.3892/or.2017.5380,Wang
25935003,Improved integrative framework combining association data with gene expression features to prioritize Crohn's disease genes.,"Genome-wide association studies in Crohn's disease (CD) have identified 140 genome-wide significant loci. However, identification of genes driving association signals remains challenging. Furthermore, genome-wide significant thresholds limit false positives at the expense of decreased sensitivity. In this study, we explored gene features contributing to CD pathogenicity, including gene-based association data from CD and autoimmune (AI) diseases, as well as gene expression features (eQTLs, epigenetic markers of expression and intestinal gene expression data). We developed an integrative model based on a CD reference gene set. This integrative approach outperformed gene-based association signals alone in identifying CD-related genes based on statistical validation, gene ontology enrichment, differential expression between M1 and M2 macrophages and a validation using genes causing monogenic forms of inflammatory bowel disease as a reference. Besides gene-level CD association P-values, association with AI diseases was the strongest predictor, highlighting generalized mechanisms of inflammation, and the interferon-γ pathway particularly. Within the 140 high-confidence CD regions, 598 of 1328 genes had low prioritization scores, highlighting genes unlikely to contribute to CD pathogenesis. For select regions, comparably high integrative model scores were observed for multiple genes. This is particularly evident for regions having extensive linkage disequilibrium such as the IBD5 locus. Our analyses provide a standardized reference for prioritizing potential CD-related genes, in regions with both highly significant and nominally significant gene-level association P-values. Our integrative model may be particularly valuable in prioritizing rare, potentially private, missense variants for which genome-wide evidence for association may be unattainable.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the characteristics of the HD-ZIP genes/proteins and to study their expression profiles under high and low temperature conditions in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.). A strict homology search was used to find 43 HD-ZIP genes located on potato chromosomes 1-12. Exons/introns, protein features and conserved motifs were analyzed, and six segment duplications were identified from 43 HD-ZIP genes. Then, we analyzed the data from the PGSC (Potato Genome Sequencing Consortium) database regarding the expression of 43 HD-ZIP genes that were induced by biotic and abiotic stresses and phytohormone treatments and conducted an expression analysis for these genes across all potato life stages. Additionally, the expression levels of 13 HD-ZIP genes were analyzed under high temperature (37 °C) and low temperature (4 °C) conditions. The results showed that the transcript levels of all 13 genes changed, which indicated that these genes respond to heat and cold in plants. Especially for StHOX20, the expression significantly upregulated in roots at 37 °C and 4 °C.

By utilizing this gene expression heterogeneity, we can obtain additional information that abets discovery of disease-associated genes. In this study, we used collaborative filtering to calculate the degree of gene expression heterogeneity between classes and then scored the genes on the basis of the degree of gene expression heterogeneity to find ""differentially predicted"" genes.

23108458,Apparent versus true gene expression changes of three hypoxia-related genes in autopsy derived tissue and the importance of normalisation.,"The aim of our work was to show how a chosen normal-isation strategy can affect the outcome of quantitative gene expression studies. As an example, we analysed the expression of three genes known to be upregulated under hypoxic conditions: HIF1A, VEGF and SLC2A1 (GLUT1). Raw RT-qPCR data were normalised using two different strategies: a straightforward normalisation against a single reference gene, GAPDH, using the 2(-ΔΔCt) algorithm and a more complex normalisation against a normalisation factor calculated from the quantitative raw data from four previously validated reference genes. We found that the two different normalisation strategies revealed contradicting results: normalising against a validated set of reference genes revealed an upregulation of the three genes of interest in three post-mortem tissue samples (cardiac muscle, skeletal muscle and brain) under hypoxic conditions. Interestingly, we found a statistically significant difference in the relative transcript abundance of VEGF in cardiac muscle between donors who died of asphyxia versus donors who died from cardiac death. Normalisation against GAPDH alone revealed no upregulation but, in some instances, a downregulation of the genes of interest. To further analyse this discrepancy, the stability of all reference genes used were reassessed and the very low expression stability of GAPDH was found to originate from the co-regulation of this gene under hypoxic conditions. We concluded that GAPDH is not a suitable reference gene for the quantitative analysis of gene expression in hypoxia and that validation of reference genes is a crucial step for generating biologically meaningful data.",2013-08-23,"Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Brain, Female, Gene Expression, Genes, Essential, Glucose Transporter Type 1, Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenases, Humans, Hypoxia, Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit, Male, Middle Aged, Muscle, Skeletal, Myocardium, Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction, Up-Regulation, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A, Young Adult",Int J Legal Med,10.1007/s00414-012-0787-2,Huth
29926120,Genes Relocated Between Drosophila Chromosome Arms Evolve Under Relaxed Selective Constraints Relative to Non-Relocated Genes.,"Gene duplication creates a second copy of a gene either in tandem to the ancestral locus or dispersed to another chromosomal location. When the ancestral copy of a dispersed duplicate is lost from the genome, it creates the appearance that the gene was ""relocated"" from the ancestral locus to the derived location. Gene relocations may be as common as canonical dispersed duplications in which both the ancestral and derived copies are retained. Relocated genes appear to be under more selective constraints than the derived copies of canonical duplications, and they are possibly as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes. To test this hypothesis, we combined comparative genomics, population genetics, gene expression, and functional analyses to assess the selection pressures acting on relocated, duplicated, and non-relocated single-copy genes in Drosophila genomes. We find that relocated genes evolve faster than single-copy non-relocated genes, and there is no evidence that this faster evolution is driven by positive selection. In addition, relocated genes are less essential for viability and male fertility than single-copy non-relocated genes, suggesting that relocated genes evolve fast because of relaxed selective constraints. However, relocated genes evolve slower than the derived copies of canonical dispersed duplicated genes. We therefore conclude that relocated genes are under more selective constraints than canonical duplicates, but are not as conserved as single-copy non-relocated genes.",2019-09-16,"Animals, Chromosomes, Drosophila, Fertility, Gene Dosage, Gene Duplication, Gene Expression Regulation, Genes, Insect, Male, Polymorphism, Genetic, RNA Interference, Testis",J Mol Evol,,Hart

However, few sesame reference genes have been selected for quantitative real-time PCR until now. Screening and validating reference genes is a requisite for gene expression normalization in sesame functional genomics research. In this study, ten candidate reference genes, i.e., SiACT, SiUBQ6, SiTUB, Si18S rRNA, SiEF1α, SiCYP, SiHistone, SiDNAJ, SiAPT and SiGAPDH, were chosen and examined systematically in 32 sesame samples. Three qRT-PCR analysis methods, i.e., geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper, were evaluated systematically. Results indicated that all ten candidate reference genes could be used as reference genes in sesame. SiUBQ6 and SiAPT were the optimal reference genes for sesame plant development; SiTUB was suitable for sesame vegetative tissue development, SiDNAJ for pathogen treatment, SiHistone for abiotic stress, SiUBQ6 for bud development and SiACT for seed germination. As for hormone treatment and seed development, SiHistone, SiCYP, SiDNAJ or SiUBQ6, as well as SiACT, SiDNAJ, SiTUB or SiAPT, could be used as reference gene, respectively. To illustrate the suitability of these reference genes, we analyzed the expression variation of three functional sesame genes of SiSS, SiLEA and SiGH in different organs using the optimal qRT-PCR system for the first time.

27053761,"Internal Duplications of DH, JH, and C Region Genes Create an Unusual IgH Gene Locus in Cattle.","It has been suspected for many years that cattle possess two functional IgH gene loci, located on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 21 and BTA11, respectively. In this study, based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and additional experiments, we showed that all functional bovine IgH genes were located on BTA21, and only a truncated μCH2 exon was present on BTA11. By sequencing of seven bacterial artificial chromosome clones screened from a Hostein cow bacterial artificial chromosome library, we generated a 678-kb continuous genomic sequence covering the bovine IGHV, IGHD, IGHJ, and IGHC genes, which are organized as IGHVn-IGHDn-IGHJn-IGHM1-(IGHDP-IGHV3-IGHDn)3-IGHJn-IGHM2-IGHD-IGHG3-IGHG1-IGHG2-IGHE-IGHA. Although both of two functional IGHM genes, IGHM1 and IGHM2, can be expressed via independent VDJ recombinations, the IGHM2 can also be expressed through class switch recombination. Likely because more IGHD segments can be involved in the expression of IGHM2, the IGHM2 gene was shown to be dominantly expressed in most tissues throughout different developmental stages. Based on the length and identity of the coding sequence, the 23 IGHD segments identified in the locus could be divided into nine subgroups (termed IGHD1 to IGHD9). Except two members of IGHD9 (14 nt in size), all other functional IGHD segments are longer than 30 nt, with the IGHD8 gene (149 bp) to be the longest. These remarkably long germline IGHD segments play a pivotal role in generating the exceptionally great H chain CDR 3 length variability in cattle.",2017-06-30,"Animals, Base Sequence, Cattle, Chromosome Mapping, Chromosomes, Artificial, Bacterial, Female, Gene Duplication, Gene Library, Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain, Humans, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains, Immunoglobulin Variable Region, In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence, Mice, V(D)J Recombination",J Immunol,10.4049/jimmunol.1600158,Ma
29620473,Selecting and validating reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in Plutella xylostella (L.).,"Gene expression analysis provides important clues regarding gene functions, and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is a widely used method in gene expression studies. Reference genes are essential for normalizing and accurately assessing gene expression. In the present study, 16 candidate reference genes (ACTB, CyPA, EF1-α, GAPDH, HSP90, NDPk, RPL13a, RPL18, RPL19, RPL32, RPL4, RPL8, RPS13, RPS4, α-TUB, and β-TUB) from Plutella xylostella were selected to evaluate gene expression stability across different experimental conditions using five statistical algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct, BestKeeper, and RefFinder). The results suggest that different reference genes or combinations of reference genes are suitable for normalization in gene expression studies of P. xylostella according to the different developmental stages, strains, tissues, and insecticide treatments. Based on the given experimental sets, the most stable reference genes were RPS4 across different developmental stages, RPL8 across different strains and tissues, and EF1-α across different insecticide treatments. A comprehensive and systematic assessment of potential reference genes for gene expression normalization is essential for post-genomic functional research in P. xylostella, a notorious pest with worldwide distribution and a high capacity to adapt and develop resistance to insecticides.",2018-09-21,"Algorithms, Animals, CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Genes, Essential, Genes, Insect, Insecticides, Moths, Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction, Reference Standards, Ribosomal Proteins",Genome,10.1139/gen-2017-0176,You
27125778,Base J represses genes at the end of polycistronic gene clusters in Leishmania major by promoting RNAP II termination.,"The genomes of kinetoplastids are organized into polycistronic gene clusters that are flanked by the modified DNA base J. Previous work has established a role of base J in promoting RNA polymerase II termination in Leishmania spp. where the loss of J leads to termination defects and transcription into adjacent gene clusters. It remains unclear whether these termination defects affect gene expression and whether read through transcription is detrimental to cell growth, thus explaining the essential nature of J. We now demonstrate that reduction of base J at specific sites within polycistronic gene clusters in L. major leads to read through transcription and increased expression of downstream genes in the cluster. Interestingly, subsequent transcription into the opposing polycistronic gene cluster does not lead to downregulation of sense mRNAs. These findings indicate a conserved role for J regulating transcription termination and expression of genes within polycistronic gene clusters in trypanosomatids. In contrast to the expectations often attributed to opposing transcription, the essential nature of J in Leishmania spp. is related to its role in gene repression rather than preventing transcriptional interference resulting from read through and dual strand transcription.",2017-07-13,"Gene Expression Regulation, Glucosides, Leishmania major, Multigene Family, RNA Polymerase II, RNA, Messenger, Transcription, Genetic, Uracil",Mol Microbiol,,Reynolds

30797967,Gene grouping strategy for network modeling from a small time-series dataset: An illustrative analysis of human organogenesis.,"Several algorithms have been proposed for modeling a gene regulatory network from a time-series expression dataset, but these have been used in relatively few studies because experimental cost often restricts the number of sampling time points to less than that of genes by more than one order of magnitude. In order to reduce the number of parameters for network modeling, we propose a method for grouping genes by both temporal expression pattern and biological function, modeling interactions between the gene groups by a dynamic Bayesian network approach. Results from applying the method to a gene expression dataset on human organogenesis demonstrate that more biologically plausible results can be obtained by modeling an interaction network for groups of genes than by modeling that for single genes.",2019-08-26,"Algorithms, Bayes Theorem, Embryo, Mammalian, Gene Expression Profiling, Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental, Gene Regulatory Networks, Genes, Humans, Models, Statistical, Organogenesis, Time Factors",Biosystems,10.1016/j.biosystems.2019.02.008,Maeda
26039571,Gene Perturbation Atlas (GPA): a single-gene perturbation repository for characterizing functional mechanisms of coding and non-coding genes.,"Genome-wide transcriptome profiling after gene perturbation is a powerful means of elucidating gene functional mechanisms in diverse contexts. The comprehensive collection and analysis of the resulting transcriptome profiles would help to systematically characterize context-dependent gene functional mechanisms and conduct experiments in biomedical research. To this end, we collected and curated over 3000 transcriptome profiles in human and mouse from diverse gene perturbation experiments, which involved 1585 different perturbed genes (microRNAs, lncRNAs and protein-coding genes) across 1170 different cell lines/tissues. For each profile, we identified differential genes and their associated functions and pathways, constructed perturbation networks, predicted transcription regulation and cancer/drug associations, and assessed cooperative perturbed genes. Based on these transcriptome analyses, the Gene Perturbation Atlas (GPA) can be used to detect (i) novel or cell-specific functions and pathways affected by perturbed genes, (ii) protein interactions and regulatory cascades affected by perturbed genes, and (iii) perturbed gene-mediated cooperative effects. The GPA is a user-friendly database to support the rapid searching and exploration of gene perturbations. Particularly, we visualized functional effects of perturbed genes from multiple perspectives. In summary, the GPA is a valuable resource for characterizing gene functions and regulatory mechanisms after single-gene perturbations. The GPA is freely accessible at http://biocc.hrbmu.edu.cn/GPA/.
